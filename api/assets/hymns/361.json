{"number":361,"title":"361. Hark! 'Tis the Shepherd's Voice I Hear","verses":["Hark! 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,\nOut in the desert dark and drear,\nCalling the sheep who've gone astray,\nFar from the Shepherd's fold away.","Who'll go and help the Shepherd kind,\nHelp Him the wandering ones to find?\nWho'll bring them back into the fold,\nWhere they'll be sheltered from the cold?","Out in the desert hear their cry,\nOut on the mountain wild and high,\nHark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee,\n\"Go, find My sheep where'er they be.\""],"chorus":"Bring them in, Bring them in,\nBring them in from the fields of sin,\nBring them in, Bring them in,\nBring the wanderers to Jesus."}
