{"number":596,"title":"596. Look for the Waymarks","verses":["Look for the way-marks as you journey on,\nLook for the way-marks passing one by one;\nDown through the ages, past the kingdoms four;\nWhere are we standing? Look the way-marks o'er.","First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,\nThen Medo-Persia's banners were unfurled;\nAnd after Greece held universal sway,\nRome seized the scepter; Where are we today?","Down in the feet of iron and of clay,\nWeak and divided, soon to pass away;\nWhat will the next great, glorious drama be?\nChrist and His coming, And eternity."],"chorus":"Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,\nDown through the ages, past the kingdoms four.\nLook for the way marks, the great prophetic way-marks;\nThe journey's almost o'er."}
