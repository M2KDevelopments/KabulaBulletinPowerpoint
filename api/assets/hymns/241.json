{"number":241,"title":"241. Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee","verses":["Jesus, the very thought of Thee,\nWith sweetness fills my breast;\nBut sweeter far Thy face to see,\nAnd in Thy presence rest.","No voice can sing, no heart can frame,\nNor can the memory find\nA sweeter sound than Jesus' name,\nThe Savior of mankind.","O hope of every contrite heart!\nO joy of all the meek,\nTo those who fall, how kind Thou art!\nHow good to those who seek!","But what to those who find? Ah! this\nNor tongue nor pen can show:\nThe love of Jesus; what it is,\nNone but His loved ones know.","Jesus, our only joy be Thou,\nAs Thou our prize wilt be;\nIn Thee be all our glory now,\nAnd through eternity."],"chorus":""}
