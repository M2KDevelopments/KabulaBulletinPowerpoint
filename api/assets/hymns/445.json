{"number":445,"title":"445. I'm But a Stranger Here","verses":["I'm but a stranger here,\nHeaven is my home;\nEarth is a desert drear,\nHeaven is my home;\nDanger and sorrow stand\nRound me on every hand;\nHeaven is my Fatherland,\nHeaven is my home.","What though the tempest rage,\nHeaven is my home;\nShort is my pilgrimage,\nHeaven is my home.\nTime's cold and wintry blast\nSoon will be over-past;\nI shall reach home at last;\nHeaven is my home.","There at my Savior's side,\nHeaven is my home;\nI shall be glorified,\nHeaven is my home.\nThere'll be the good and blest,\nThose I love most and best,\nThere, too, I soon shall rest;\nHeaven is my home."],"chorus":""}
