{"number":474,"title":"474. Take the Name of Jesus With You","verses":["Take the name of Jesus with you,\nChild of sorrow and of woe;\nIt will joy and comfort give you,\nTake it, then, where'er you go.","Take the name of Jesus ever,\nAs a shield from every snare;\nIf temptations round you gather,\nBreathe that holy name in prayer.","O the precious name of Jesus!\nHow it thrills our souls with joy,\nWhen His loving arms receive us,\nAnd His songs our tongues employ.","At the name of Jesus bowing,\nFalling prostrate at His feet,\nKing of kings in heaven we'll crown Him,\nWhen our journey is complete."],"chorus":"Precious name, O how sweet!\nHope of earth and joy of heaven;\nPrecious name, O how sweet!\nHope of earth and joy of heaven."}
