Sweet By and By","verses":["There's a land that is fairer than day,\nAnd by faith we can see it afar;\nFor the Father waits over the way,\nTo prepare us a dwelling place there.","We shall sing on that beautiful shore\nThe melodious songs of the blest,\nAnd our spirits shall sorrow no more,\nNot a sigh for the blessing of rest.","To our bountiful Father above,\nWe will offer a tribute of praise,\nFor the glorious gift of His love,\nAnd the blessings that hallow our days."],"chorus":"In the sweet by and by,\nWe shall meet on that beautiful shore;\nIn the sweet by and by,\nWe shall meet on that beautiful shore."}
