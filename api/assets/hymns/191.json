{"number":191,"title":"191. Love Divine","verses":["Love divine, all loves excelling,\nJoy of heaven, to earth come down;\nFix in us Thy humble dwelling,\nAll Thy faithful mercies crown!\nJesus, Thou art all compassion,\nPure, unbounded love Thou art;\nVisit us with Thy salvation,\nEnter every trembling heart.","Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit\nInto every troubled breast!\nLet us all in Thee inherit,\nLet us find the promised rest;\nTake away our bent to sinning;\nAlpha and Omega be;\nEnd of faith, as its beginning,\nSet our hearts at liberty.","Come, Almighty to deliver,\nLet us all Thy grace receive;\nSuddenly return, and never,\nNevermore Thy temples leave.\nThee we would be always blessing,\nServe Thee as Thy hosts above,\nPray, and praise Thee without ceasing,\nGlory in Thy perfect love.","Finish, then, Thy new creation;\nPure and spotless let us be;\nLet us see Thy great salvation\nPerfectly restored in Thee:\nChanged from glory into glory,\nTill in heaven we take our place,\nTill we cast our crowns before Thee,\nLost in wonder, love, and praise."],"chorus":""}
