Of the Father's Love Begotten","verses":["Of the Father's love begotten,\nEre the worlds began to be,\nHe is Alpha and Omega,\nHe the source, the ending He,\nOf the things that are, that have been,\nAnd that future years shall see,\nEvermore and evermore!","O ye heights of heaven adore Him;\nAngel hosts, His praises sing;\nPowers, dominions, bow before Him,\nAnd extol our God and King;\nLet no tongue on earth be silent,\nEvery voice in concert ring,\nEvermore and evermore!","Christ, to Thee with God the Father\nAnd, O Holy Ghost, to Thee\nHymn and chant and high thanksgiving\nAnd unwearied praises be.\nHonor, glory, and dominion,\nAnd eternal victory,\nEvermore and evermore! Amen."],"chorus":""}
