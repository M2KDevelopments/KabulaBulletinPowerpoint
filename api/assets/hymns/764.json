{"title":"764. Reconciliation - 2 Corinthians 5  ","number":764,"verses":["We are ruled by the love of Christ,\nnow that we recognize that one man died for everyone,\nwhich means that they all share in his death.","He died for all, so that those who live\nshould no longer live for themselves,\nbut only for him who died and was\nraised to life for their sake.","No longer, then, do we judge anyone\nby human standards.\nEven if at one time we judged Christ\naccording to human standards,\nwe no longer do so.","When anyone is joined to Christ,\nhe is a new being; the old is gone,\nthe new has come.","All this is done by God,\nwho through Christ changed us\nfrom enemies into his friends and gave\nus the task of making others his friends also.","Our message is that God was making\nall mankind his friends through Christ.\nGod did not keep an account of their sins,\nand he has given us the message which tells\nhow he makes them his friends.","Here we are, then, speaking for Christ,\nas though God himself were making\nhis appeal through us.\nWe plead on Christ's behalf:\nlet God change you from enemies into his friends!","Christ was without sin,\nbut for our sake God made him share\nour sin in order that in union with him\nwe might share the righteousness of God."]}
