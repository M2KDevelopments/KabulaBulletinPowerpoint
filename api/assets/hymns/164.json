There Is a Green Hill Far Away","verses":["There is a green hill far away,\nWithout a city wall,\nWhere the dear Lord was crucified,\nWho died to save us all.","We may not know, we cannot tell,\nWhat pains He had to bear,\nBut we believe it was for us\nHe hung and suffered there.","He died that we might be forgiven,\nHe died to make us good,\nThat we might go at last to heaven,\nSaved by His precious blood.","There was no other good enough\nTo pay the price of sin;\nHe only could unlock the gate\nOf heaven, and let us in.","O dearly, dearly has He loved!\nAnd we must love Him too,\nAnd trust in His redeeming blood,\nAnd try His works to do."],"chorus":""}
