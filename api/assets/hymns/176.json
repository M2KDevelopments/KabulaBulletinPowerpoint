Hail the Day That Sees Him Rise","verses":["Hail the day that sees Him rise, Alleluia!\nGlorious to His native skies; Alleluia!\nChrist, awhile to mortals giv'n, Alleluia!\nEnters now the highest heav'n! Alleluia!","There the glorious triumph waits; Alleluia!\nLift your heads, eternal gates! Alleluia!\nWide unfold the radiant scene; Alleluia!\nTake the King of glory in! Alleluia!","See! He lifts His hands above; Alleluia!\nSee! He shows the prints of love: Alleluia!\nHark! His gracious lips bestow, Alleluia!\nBlessings on His Church below. Alleluia!","Lord beyond our mortal sight, Alleluia!\nRaise our hearts to reach Thy height, Alleluia!\nThere Thy face unclouded see, Alleluia!\nFind our heav'n of heav'ns in Thee. Alleluia!"],"chorus":""}
