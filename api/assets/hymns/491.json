{"number":491,"title":"491. In the Hour of Trial","verses":["In the hour of trial,\nJesus, plead for me,\nLest by base denial\nI depart from Thee;\nWhen Thou see'st me waver,\nWith a look recall,\nNor, for fear or favor,\nSuffer me to fall.","With forbidden pleasures,\nWould this vain world charm;\nOr its sordid treasures\nSpread to work me harm;\nBring to my remembrance\nSad Gethsemane,\nOr, in darker semblance,\nCross-crowned Calvary.","Should Thy mercy send me\nSorrow, toil, and woe,\nOr should pain attend me\nOn my path below,\nGrant that I may never\nFail Thy hand to see;\nGrant that I may ever\nCast my care on Thee."],"chorus":""}
