{"number":632,"title":"632. Until Then","verses":["My heart can sing when I pause to remember\nA heartache here is but a stepping stone\nAlong a trail that's winding always upward,\nThis troubled world is not my final home.","The things of earth will dim and lose their value\nIf we recall they're borrowed for a while;\nAnd things of earth that cause the heart to tremble,\nRemembered there will only bring a smile."],"chorus":"But until then my heart will go on singing,\nUntil then with joy I'll carry on\nUntil the day my eyes behold the city,\nUntil the day God calls me home."}
