{"number":633,"title":"633. When We All Get to Heaven","verses":["Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,\nSing His mercy and His grace;\nIn the mansions bright and blessed\nHe'll prepare for us a place.","While we walk the pilgrim pathway\nClouds will overspread the sky;\nBut when traveling days are over\nNot a shadow, not a sigh.","Let us then be true and faithful,\nTrusting, serving every day;\nJust one glimpse of Him in glory\nWill the toils of life repay.","Onward to the prize before us!\nSoon His beauty we'll behold;\nSoon the pearly gates will open\nWe shall tread the streets of gold."],"chorus":"When we all get to heaven,\nWhat a day of rejoicing that will be!\nWhen we all see Jesus,\nWe'll sing and shout the victory!"}
