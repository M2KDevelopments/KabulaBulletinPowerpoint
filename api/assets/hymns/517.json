My Faith Looks Up to Thee","verses":["My faith looks up to Thee,\nThou Lamb of Calvary,\nSavior divine;\nNow hear me while I pray,\nTake all my guilt away,\nO let me from this day\nBe wholly Thine.","May Thy rich grace impart\nStrength to my fainting heart,\nMy zeal inspire;\nAs Thou hast died for me,\nO may my love to Thee\nPure, warm, and changeless be,\nA living fire.","While life's dark maze I tread,\nAnd griefs around me spread,\nBe Thou my Guide;\nBid darkness turn to day,\nWipe sorrow's tears away.\nNor let me ever stray\nFrom Thee aside."],"chorus":""}
