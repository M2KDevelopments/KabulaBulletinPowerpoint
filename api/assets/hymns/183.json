I Will Sing of Jesus' Love","verses":["I will sing of Jesus' love,\nSing of Him who first loved me;\nFor He left bright worlds above,\nAnd died on Calvary.","O the depths of love divine!\nEarth or heaven can never know\nHow that sins as dark as mine\nCan be made as white as snow.","Nothing good for Him I've done;\nHow could He such love bestow?\nLord, I own my heart is won,\nHelp me now my love to show."],"chorus":"I will sing of Jesus' love,\nEndless praise my heart shall give;\nHe has died that I might live;\nI will sing His love to me."}
