{"number":302,"title":"302. Deeper Yet","verses":["In the blood from the cross\nI have been washed from sin;\nBut to be free from dross,\nStill I would enter in.","Day by day, hour by hour,\nBlessings are sent to me;\nBut for more of His power\nEver my prayer shall be.","Near to Christ I would live,\nFollowing Him each day;\nWhat I ask He will give;\nSo then with faith I pray.","Now I have peace, sweet peace,\nWhile in this world of sin;\nBut to pray I'll not cease\nTill I am pure within."],"chorus":"Deeper yet, deeper yet,\nInto the crimson flood;\nDeeper yet, deeper yet,\nUnder the precious blood."}
