{"number":291,"title":"291. We Have Not Known Thee","verses":["We have not known Thee as we ought,\nNor learned Thy wisdom, grace, and power;\nThe things of earth have led our thought,\nAnd trifles of the passing hour.\nLord, give us light Thy truth to see,\nAnd make us wise in knowing Thee.","We have not feared Thee as we ought,\nNor bowed beneath Thine awful eye,\nNor guarded deed, and word, and thought,\nRemembering that God was nigh.\nLord, give us faith to know Thee near,\nAnd grant the grace of holy fear.","We have not loved Thee as we ought,\nNor cared that we are loved by Thee;\nThy presence we have coldly sought,\nAnd feebly longed Thy face to see.\nLord, give a pure and loving heart\nTo feel and own the love Thou art.","We have not served Thee as we ought;\nAlas! the duties left undone,\nThe work with little fervor wrought,\nThe battles lost, or scarcely won!\nLord, give the zeal, and give the might,\nFor Thee to toil, for Thee to fight.","When shall we know Thee as we ought,\nAnd fear, and love, and serve aright!\nWhen shall we, out of trial brought,\nBe perfect in the land of light!\nLord, may we day by day prepare\nTo see Thy face, and serve Thee there."],"chorus":""}
