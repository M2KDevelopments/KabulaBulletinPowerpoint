Day Is Dying in the West","verses":["Day is dying in the west;\nHeaven is touching earth with rest;\nWait and worship while the night\nSets the evening lamps alight\nThrough all the sky.","Lord of life, beneath the dome\nOf the universe, Thy home,\nGather us who seek Thy face\nTo the fold of Thy embrace,\nFor Thou art nigh.","While the deepening shadows fall,\nHeart of love enfolding all,\nThro' the glory and the grace\nOf the stars that veil Thy face,\nOur hearts ascend.","When forever from our sight\nPass the stars, the day, the night,\nLord of angels, on our eyes\nLet eternal morning rise\nAnd shadows end."],"chorus":"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!\nHeaven and earth are full of Thee;\nHeaven and earth are praising Thee,\nO Lord most high!"}
