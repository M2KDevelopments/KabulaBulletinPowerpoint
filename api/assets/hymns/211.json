{"number":211,"title":"211. Lo! He Comes","verses":["Lo! He comes, with clouds descending,\nOnce for favored sinners slain;\nCountless angels, Him attending,\nSwell the triumph of His train:\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nJesus comes, and comes to reign.","Every eye shall now behold Him\nRobed in dreadful majesty!\nThose who set at nought and sold Him,\nPierced, and nailed Him to the tree,\nDeeply wailing, Deeply wailing,\nShall the true Messiah see!","When the solemn trump has sounded,\nHeaven and earth shall flee away;\nAll who hate Him, must, confounded,\nHear the summons of that day\n\"Come to judgment! Come to judgment!\nCome to judgment! Come away!\"","Yea, amen! let all adore Thee,\nHigh on Thy eternal throne!\nSavior, take the power and glory,\nMake Thy righteous sentence known;\nO come quickly, O come quickly,\nClaim the kingdom for Thine own!"],"chorus":""}
