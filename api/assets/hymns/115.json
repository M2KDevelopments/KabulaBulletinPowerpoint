O Come, O Come, Immanuel","verses":["O come, O come, Immanuel,\nAnd ransom captive Israel\nThat mourns in lonely exile here\nUntil the Son of God appear.","O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,\nAnd order all things far and nigh;\nTo us the path of knowledge show,\nAnd cause us in her ways to go.","O come, Desire of nations, bind\nAll peoples in one heart and mind;\nBid envy, strife, and quarrels cease;\nFill the whole world with heaven's peace."],"chorus":"Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel\nShall come to thee, O Israel!"}
