Lord Jesus Once You Spoke to Men","verses":["Lord Jesus, once You spoke to men\nUpon the mountain and the plain,\nO help us listen now as then\r\nAnd wonder at Your words again.","We all have secret fears to face,\nOur minds and motives to amend.\nWe seek Your truth, we need Your grace,\nOur living Lord and present friend.","The gospel speaks; and we receive\nYour light, Your love, Your own command.\nO help us live what we believe,\nIn daily word of heart and hand."],"chorus":""}
