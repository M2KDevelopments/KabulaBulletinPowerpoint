Fire of God Thou Sacred Flame","verses":["Fire of God, Thou sacred flame,\nSpirit who in splendor came,\nLet Thy heat my soul refine\nTill it glows with love divine.","Breath of God, that swept in power\nIn the pentecostal hour,\nHoly Breath, be Thou in me\nSource of vital energy.","Strength of God, Thy might within\r\nConquers sorrow, pain, and sin:\nFortify from evil's art\nAll the gateways of my heart.","Truth of God, Thy piercing rays\nPenetrate my secret ways.\nMay the light that shames my sin\nGuide me holier paths to win.","Love of God, Thy grace profound\r\nKnoweth neither age nor bound:\nCome, my heart's own guest to be,\nDwell forevermore in me."],"chorus":""}
