Awake, My Soul","verses":["Awake, my soul! stretch every nerve,\nAnd press with vigor on;\nA heavenly race demands thy zeal,\nAnd an immortal crown.","'Tis God's all animating voice\nThat calls thee from on high;\n'Tis He whose hand presents the prize\nTo thine aspiring eye.","A cloud of witnesses around\nHold thee in full survey;\nForget the steps already trod,\nAnd onward urge thy way.","Blest Savior, introduced by Thee,\nOur race have we begun;\nAnd, crowned with victory, at Thy feet\nWe'll lay our trophies down."],"chorus":""}
