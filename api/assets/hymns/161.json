{"number":161,"title":"161. Throned Upon the Awful Tree","verses":["Throned upon the awful tree,\nLamb of God, Your grief we see.\nDarkness veils Your anguished face;\nNone its lines of woe can trace.\nNone can tell what pangs unknown\nHold You silent and alone.","Silent through those three dread hours,\nWrestling with the evil powers,\nLeft alone with human sin,\nGloom around You and within,\nTill th'appointed time is nigh,\n'Till the Lamb of God may die.","Hark, that cry that peals aloud\nUpward through the whelming cloud!\nYou, the Father's only Son,\nYou, His own anointed one,\nYou are asking can it be?\n\"Why have You forsaken Me?\"","Lord, should fear and anguish roll\nDarkly o'er our sinful soul,\nYou, who once were thus bereft\nThat Your own might ne'er be left,\nTeach us by that bitter cry\nIn the gloom to know You nigh."],"chorus":""}
