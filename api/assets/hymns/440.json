How Cheering Is the Christian's Hope","verses":["How cheering is the Christianâ€™s hope,\nWhile toiling here below!\nIt bouys us up while this passing through\nThis wilderness of woe.","It bouys us up while this passing through\nThis wilderness of woe,\nIt bouys us up while passing through\nThis wilderness of woe.","It points us to a land of rest,\nWhere saints with Christ will reign;\nWhere we shall meet the loved of earth,\nAnd never part again.","Fly, lingering moments, fly, O, fly,\nDear Savior, quickly come!\nWe long to see Thee as Thou art,\nAnd reach that blissful home."],"chorus":""}
