{"number":528,"title":"528. A Shelter in the Time of Storm","verses":["The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide,\nA shelter in the time of storm;\nSecure whatever may betide,\nA shelter in the time of storm.","A shade by day, defense by night,\nA shelter in the time of storm;\nNo fears alarm, no foes affright,\nA shelter in the time of storm.","The raging floods may round us beat,\nA shelter in the time of storm;\nWe find in God a safe retreat,\nA shelter in the time of storm.","O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,\nA shelter in the time of storm;\nBe Thou our helper, ever near,\nA shelter in the time of storm."],"chorus":"Mighty Rock in a weary land,\nCooling shade on the burning sand,\nFaithful guide for the pilgrim band;\nA shelter in the time of storm."}
