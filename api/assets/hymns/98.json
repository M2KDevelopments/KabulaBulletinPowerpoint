{"number":98,"title":"98. Can You Count the Stars?","verses":["Can you count the stars that brightly\nTwinkle in the midnight sky?\nCan you count the clouds, so lightly\nO'er the meadows floating by?\nGod, the Lord, doth mark their number\nWith His eyes that never slumber;\nHe hath made them every one,\nHe hath made them every one.","Can you count the wings now flashing\nIn the sunshine's golden light?\nCan you count the fishes splashing\nIn the cooling waters bright?\nGod, the Lord, a name hath given,\nTo all creatures under heaven;\nHe hath named them every one,\nHe hath named them every one.","Do you know how many children\nRise each morning blithe and gay?\nCan you count their jolly voices,\nSinging sweetly day by day?\nGod hears all the happy voices,\nIn their merry songs rejoices;\nAnd He loves them, every one,\nAnd He loves them, every one."],"chorus":""}
