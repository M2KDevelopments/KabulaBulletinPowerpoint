This Is the Threefold Truth","verses":["This is the threefold truth\nOn which our faith depends;\nAnd with this joyful cry\nWorship begins and ends;","By this we are upheld\nWhen doubt and grief assail\nOur Christian fortitude,\nAnd only grace avails.","This is the threefold truth\nWhich, if we hold it fast,\nChanges the world and us\nAnd brings us home at last."],"chorus":"Christ had died!\nChrist has risen!\nChrist will come again!"}
