New Songs of Celebration Render","verses":["New songs of celebration render\nTo Him who has great wonders done.\nLove sits enthroned in ageless splendor:\nCome, and adore the mighty One.\nHe has made known His great salvation\nWhich all His friends with joy confess:\nHe has revealed to every nation\nHis everlasting righteousness.","Joyfully, heartily resounding,\nLet every instrument and voice\r\nPeal out the praise of grace abounding,\nCalling the whole world to rejoice.\nTrumpets and organs, set in motion\nSuch sounds as make the heavens ring;\nAll things that live in earth and ocean,\nMake music for your mighty King.","Rivers and seas and torrents roaring,\nHonor the Lord with wild acclaim;\nMountains and stones look up adoring,\nAnd find a voice to praise His name.\nRighteous, commanding, ever glorious,\nPraises be His that never cease:\nJust is our God, whose truth victorious\nEstablishes the world in peace."],"chorus":""}
