{"number":510,"title":"510. If You Trust in God to Guide You","verses":["If you but trust in God to guide you\nAnd place your confidence in Him,\nYou'll find Him always there beside you,\nTo give you hope and strength within.\nFor those who trust God's changeless love\nBuild on the rock that will not move.","What gain is there in futile weeping,\nIn helpless anger and distress?\nIf you are in His care and keeping,\nIn sorrow will He love you less?\nFor He who took for you a cross\nWill bring you safe through every loss.","In patient trust await His leisure\nIn cheerful hope, with heart content\nTo take whate'er your Father's pleasure\nAnd all-discerning love have sent;\nDoubt not your inmost wants are known\nTo Him who chose you for His own.","Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving,\nOffer your service faithfully,\nAnd trust His word; though undeserving,\nYou'll find His promise true to be.\nGod never will forsake in need\nThe soul that trusts in Him indeed."],"chorus":""}
