We'll Build on the Rock","verses":["We'll build on the Rock, the living Rock,\nOn Jesus, the Rock of Ages;\nSo shall we abide the fearful shock,\nWhen loud the tempest rages.","Some build on the sinking sands of life,\nOn visions of earthly treasure;\nSome build on the waves of sin and strife,\nOf fame, and worldly pleasure.","O build on the Rock forever sure,\nThe firm and the true foundation;\nIts hope is the hope which shall endure,\nThe hope of our salvation."],"chorus":"We'll build on the Rock,\nWe'll build on the Rock;\nWe'll build on the Rock, on the solid Rock,\nOn Christ, the mighty Rock."}
