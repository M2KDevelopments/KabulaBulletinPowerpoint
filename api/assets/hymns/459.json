As the Bridegroom to His Chosen","verses":["As the bridegroom to his chosen,\nas the king to his realm,\nAs the keep unto the castle,\nas the pilot to the helm,\nSo, Lord, art Thou to me.","As the fountain in the garden,\nas the candle in the dark,\nAs the treasure in the coffer,\r\nas the manna in the ark,\nSo, Lord, art Thou to me.","As the ruby in the setting,\r\nas the honey in the comb,\nAs the light within the lantern,\r\nas the father in the home,\nSo, Lord, art Thou to me.","As the sunshine in the heavens,\r\nas the image in the glass,\r\nAs the fruits up in the fig tree,\r\nas the dew upon the grass,\nSo, Lord, art Thou to me."],"chorus":""}
