Come O Sabbath Day","verses":["Come, O Sabbath day, and bring\nPeace and healing on thy wing;\nAnd to every troubled breast\nSpeak of the divine behest:\nThou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!","Earthly longings bid retire,\nQuench the passions' hurtful fire;\nTo the wayward, sin oppressed,\nBring thou thy divine behest:\nThou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!","Wipe from every cheek the tear,\nBanish care and silence fear;\nAll things working for the best,\nTeach us the divine behest:\nThou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!"],"chorus":""}
