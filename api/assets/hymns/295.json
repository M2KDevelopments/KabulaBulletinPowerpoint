{"number":295,"title":"295. Chief of Sinners","verses":["Chief of sinners though I be,\nJesus shed His blood for me;\nDied that I might live on high,\nDied that I might never die;\nAs the branch is to the vine,\nI am His, and He is mine.","O the height of Jesus' love!\nHigher than the heaven above,\nDeeper than the deepest sea,\nLasting as eternity;\nLove that found me; wondrous thought!\nFound me when I sought Him not!","Chief of sinners though I be,\nChrist is all in all to me;\nAll my wants to Him are known,\nAll my sorrows are His own;\nSafe with Him from earthly strife,\nHe sustains the hidden life."],"chorus":""}
