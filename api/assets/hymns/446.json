Lo, What a Glorious Sight Appears","verses":["Lo, what a glorious sight appears\nTo our believing eyes!\nThe earth and seas are passed away,\nAnd the old rolling skies.\nAnd the old rolling skies,\nAnd the old rolling skies;\nThe earth and seas are passed a way,\nAnd the old rolling skies.","Attending angels shout for joy\nAnd the bright armies sing;\nMortals! behold the sacred seat\nOf your descending King.\nOf your descending King,\nOf your descending King;\nMortals! behold the sacred seat\nOf your descending King.","His own soft hand shall wipe the tears\nFrom every weeping eye;\nAnd pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears,\nAnd death itself shall die!\nAnd death itself shall die,\nAnd death itself shall die;\nAnd pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears,\nAnd death itself shall die.","How long, dear Savior! oh, how long\nShall this bright hour delay?\nFly swifter round, ye wheels of time!\nAnd bring the welcome day.\nAnd bring the welcome day,\nAnd bring the welcome day;\nFly swifter round, ye wheels of time!\nAnd bring the welcome day."],"chorus":"O that will be joyful, joyful, joyful!\nO that will be joyful\nWhen we meet to part no more!\nWhen we meet to part no more\nOn Canaan's happy shore;\nTis there we'll meet at Jesus' feet,\nWhen we meet to part no more!"}
