{"number":216,"title":"216. When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder","verses":["When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound,\nAnd time shall be no more,\nAnd the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;\nWhen the saved of earth shall gather\nOver on the other shore,\nAnd the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.","On that bright and cloudless morning,\nWhen the dead in Christ shall rise,\nAnd the glory of His resurrection share;\nWhen His chosen ones shall gather\nTo their home beyond the skies,\nAnd the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.","Let us labor for the Master\nFrom the dawn till setting sun,\nLet us talk of all His wondrous love and care,\nThen, when all of life is over,\nAnd our work on earth is done,\nAnd the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there."],"chorus":"When the roll is called up yonder,\nWhen the roll is called up yonder,\nWhen the roll is called up yonder,\nWhen the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there."}
