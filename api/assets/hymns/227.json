{"number":227,"title":"227. Jesus Shall Reign","verses":["Jesus shall reign where e'r the sun\nDoes its successive journeys run;\nHis kingdom stretch from shore to shore,\nTill moons shall wax and wane no more.","People and realms of every tongue\nDwell on His love with sweetest song;\nAnd infant voices shall proclaim\nTheir earthly blessings on His name.","Blessings abound where e'r He reigns:\nThe pris'ners leap to lose their chains,\nThe weary find eternal rest,\nAnd all who suffer want are blest.","Let every creature rise and bring\nHonors peculiar to our King;\nAngels descend with songs again,\nAnd earth repeat the loud amen."],"chorus":""}
