{"number":287,"title":"287. Softly and Tenderly","verses":["Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,\nCalling for you and for me;\nAt the heart's portal He's waiting and watching,\nWatching for you and for me.","Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,\nPleading for you and for me?\nWhy should we linger and heed not His mercies,\nMercies for you and for me?","Think of the wonderful love He has promised,\nPromised for you and for me;\nThough we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon,\nPardon for you and for me."],"chorus":"Come home, come home,\nYe who are weary, come home;\nEarnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling,\nCalling, O sinner, come home!"}
