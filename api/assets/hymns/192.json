O Shepherd Divine","verses":["O Shepherd divine, I know Thou art mine;\nThy search in the night was for me.\nThis bleak world is cold, but warm is Thy fold;\nMy Shepherd, I follow Thee.\nThy beautiful lamp shineth bright o'er my way,\nThy glorious light unto Thy perfect day.\nThro' pastures serene, Thro' valleys of green,\nMy Shepherd, I follow Thee.","O Shepherd divine, I know Thou art mine;\nThy great heart was broken for me.\nThy grace and Thy law I picture in awe;\nThey kissed upon Calvary.\nAh! life that was given to ransom my soul,\nAh! heart that was broken to make sinners whole,\nThis world is but loss In view of Thy cross,\nMy Shepherd, I follow Thee.","O Shepherd divine, I know Thou art mine;\nI hear Thee say, \"Follow thou Me.\"\nThy message today illumines my way;\nThe Spirit of Prophecy.\nI thrill at Thy marvelous love to Thy sheep,\nThe way Thou dost lead to the still waters deep,\nOne staff and one rod, One fold and one God,\nMy Shepherd, I follow Thee."],"chorus":""}
