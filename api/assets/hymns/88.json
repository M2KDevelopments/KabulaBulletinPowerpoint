{"number":88,"title":"88. I Sing the Mighty Power of God","verses":["I sing the mighty power of God,\nThat made the mountains rise,\nThat spread the flowing seas abroad,\nAnd built the lofty skies;\nI sing the wisdom that ordained\nThe sun to rule the day;\nThe moon shines full at His command,\nAnd all the stars obey.","I sing the goodness of the Lord,\nThat filled the earth with food;\nHe formed the creatures with His word,\nAnd then pronounced them good.\nLord, how Thy wonders are displayed\nWhere'er I turn my eye!\nIf I survey the ground I tread,\nOr gaze upon the sky!","There's not a plant or flower below\nBut makes Thy glories known;\nAnd clouds arise, and tempests blow,\nBy order from Thy throne.\nCreatures that borrow life from Thee\nAre subject to Thy care;\nThere's not a place where we can flee\nBut God is present there."],"chorus":""}
