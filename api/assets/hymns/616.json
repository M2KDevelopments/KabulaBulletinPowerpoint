{"number":616,"title":"616. Soldiers of Christ Arise","verses":["Soldiers of Christ, arise,\nAnd put your armor on,\nStrong in the strength which God supplies\nThrough His eternal Son;\nStrong in the Lord of hosts,\nAnd in His mighty power,\nWho in the strength of Jesus trusts\nIs more than conqueror.","Stand, then, in His great might,\nWith all His strength endued;\nBut take, to arm you for the fight,\nThe panoply of God;\nThat, having all things done,\nAnd all your conflicts passed,\nYou may o'ercome thro' Christ alone,\nAnd stand entire at last.","From strength to strength go on;\nWrestle, and fight, and pray;\nTread all the powers of darkness down,\nAnd win the well-fought day;\nStill let the Spirit cry,\nIn all His soldiers \"Come!\"\nTill Christ the Lord who reigns on high\nShall take the conquerors home."],"chorus":""}
