        "Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!\nO my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!\nAll ye who hear, now to His temple draw near;\nJoin ye in glad adoration!",
        "Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,\nShieldeth thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!\nHast thou not seen how thy desires e'er have been\nGranted in what He ordaineth?",
        "Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;\nSurely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee.\nPonder anew what the Almighty can do,\nIf with His love He befriend thee."
