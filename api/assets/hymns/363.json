{"number":363,"title":"363. Lord, Whose Love In Humble Service","verses":["Lord, whose love in humble service\nBore the weight of human need,\nWho upon the cross, forsaken,\nWorked Your mercy's perfect deed:\nWe, Your servants, bring the worship\nNot of voice alone, but heart;\nConsecrating to Your purpose\nEvery gift which You impart.","Still Your children wander homeless;\nStill the hungry cry for bread;\nStill the captives long for freedom;\nStill in grief we mourn our dead.\nAs You, Lord, in deep compassion\nHealed the sick and freed the soul,\nBy Your Spirit send Your power\nTo our world to make it whole.","As we worship, grant us vision,\nTill your love's revealing light\nIn its height and depth and greatness\nDawns upon our quickened sight,\nMaking known the needs and burdens\nYour compassion bids us bear,\nStirring us to ardent service,\nYour abundant life to share."],"chorus":""}
