{"number":102,"title":"102. Unto the Hills","verses":["Unto the hills around shall I lift up my longing eyes?\nO whence for me shall my salvation come, from whence arise?\nFrom God the Lord doth come my certain aid,\nFrom God the Lord, who heav'n and earth hath made.","He will not suffer that thy foot be moved; safe shalt Thou be\nNo careless slumber shall His eyelids close, who keepeth thee.\nBehold our God, the Lord, He slumbereth ne'er,\nWho keepeth Israel in His holy care.","Jehovah is Himself thy keeper true, thy changeless shade.\nJehovah thy defense on thy right hand Himself hath made\nAnd thee no sun by day shall ever smite,\nNo moon shall harm thee in the silent night.","From every evil shall He keep thy soul, from every sin;\nJehovah shall preserve thy going out, thy coming in.\nAbove thee watching, He, whom adore,\nShall keep thee henceforth, yea, forevermore."],"chorus":""}
