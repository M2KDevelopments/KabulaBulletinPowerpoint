{"number":457,"title":"457. I Love to Tell the Story","verses":["I love to tell the story\nOf unseen things above,\nOf Jesus and His glory,\nOf Jesus and His love;\nI love to tell the story,\nBecause I know 'tis true;\nIt satisfies my longing\nAs nothing else can do.","I love to tell the story;\nMore wonderful it seems\nThan all the golden fancies\nOf all our golden dreams;\nI love to tell the story,\nIt did so much for me,\nAnd that is just the reason\nI tell it now to thee.","I love to tell the story;\n'Tis pleasant to repeat\nWhat seems each time I tell it,\nMore wonderfully sweet;\nI love to tell the story,\nFor some have never heard\nThe message of salvation\nFrom God's own holy word.","I love to tell the story;\nFor those who know it best\nSeem hungering and thirsting\nTo hear it like the rest;\nAnd when in scenes of glory\nI sing the new, new song,\n'Twill be the old, old story\nThat I have loved so long."],"chorus":"I love to tell the story;\n'Twill be my theme in glory\nTo tell the old, old story\nOf Jesus and His love."}
