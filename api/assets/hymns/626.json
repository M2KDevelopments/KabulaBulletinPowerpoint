{"number":626,"title":"626. In a Little While We're Going Home","verses":["Let us sing a song that will cheer us by the way,\nIn a little while we're going home;\nFor the night will end in the everlasting day,\nIn a little while we're going home.","We will do the work that our hands may find to do,\nIn a little while we're going home;\nAnd the grace of God will our daily strength renew,\nIn a little while we're going home.","We will smooth the path for some weary, wayworn feet,\nIn a little while we're going home;\nAnd may loving hearts spread around an influence sweet!\nIn a little while we're going home.","There's a rest beyond, there's relief from every care,\nIn a little while we're going home;\nAnd no tears shall fall in that city bright and fair,\nIn a little while we're going home."],"chorus":"In a little while, In a little while,\nWe shall cross the billow's foam;\nWe shall meet at last,\nWhen the stormy winds are past,\nIn a little while we're going home."}
