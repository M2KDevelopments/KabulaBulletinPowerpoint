{"number":389,"title":"389. Light of Light, Enlighten Me","verses":["Light of light, enlighten me,\nNow anew the day is dawning;\nSun of grace, the shadows flee;\nBrighten Thou my Sabbath morning;\nWith Thy joyous sunshine blest,\nHappy is my day of rest.","Let me with my heart today,\nHoly, holy, holy, singing,\nRapt awhile from earth away,\nAll my soul to Thee up springing,\nHave a foretaste inward given\nHow they worship Thee in heaven.","Hence all care, all vanity!\nFor the day to God is holy;\nCome, Thou glorious Majesty,\nDeign to fill this temple lowly;\nNought today my soul shall move,\nSimply resting in Thy love."],"chorus":""}
