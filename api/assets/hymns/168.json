And Have the Bright Immensities","verses":["And have the bright immensities\nReceived our risen Lord,\nWhere light years frame the Pleiades\nAnd point Orion's sword?\nDo flaming suns His footsteps trace\r\nThro' corridors sublime,\nThe Lord of interstellar space\nAnd conqueror of time?","The heav'n that hides Him from our sight\nKnows neither near nor far;\nA little candle sheds its light\nAs surely as a star.\nAnd where His loving people meet\nTo share the gift divine,\nThere stands He with unhurrying feet;\nThere heav'nly splendors shine."],"chorus":""}
