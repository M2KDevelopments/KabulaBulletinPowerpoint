The Son of God Proclaim","verses":["The Son of God proclaim,\nThe Lord of time and space;\nThe God who bade the light break forth\nNow shines in Jesus' face.","Behold His outstretched hands,\nThough all was in His power\nHe took the towel and basin then,\nAnd serves us in this hour.","He, God's creative word,\nThe church's Lord and head,\nHere bids us gather as His friends,\nAnd share His wine and bread.","The Lord of life and death\nWith wondering praise we sing;\nWe break the bread at His command,\nAnd name Him God and King.","We take this cup in hope:\nFor He, who gladly bore\nThe shameful cross, is ris'n again,\nAnd reigns forevermore."],"chorus":""}
