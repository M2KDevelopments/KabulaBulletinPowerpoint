Happy the Home That Welcomes You","verses":["Happy the home that welcomes You, Lord Jesus,\nTruest of friends, most honored guest of all,\nWhere hearts and eyes are bright with joy to greet You,\nYour lightest wishes eager to fulfill.","Happy the home where man and wife together\nAre of one mind believing in Your love:\nThrough love and pain, prosperity and hardship,\nThrough good and evil days Your care they prove.","Happy the home, O loving Friend of children,\nWhere they are giv'n to You with hands of prayer,\nWhere at Your feet they early learn to listen\nTo Your own words, and thank You for Your care"],"chorus":""}
