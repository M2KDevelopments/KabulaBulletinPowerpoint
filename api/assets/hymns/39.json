Lord, in the Morning","verses":["Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear\nMy voice ascending high;\nTo Thee will I direct my prayer,\nTo Thee lift up mine eye;","Up to the hills where Christ is gone\nTo plead for all His saints,\nPresenting at His Father's throne\nOur songs and our complaints.","O may Thy Spirit guide my feet\nIn ways of righteousness;\nMake every path of duty straight\nAnd plain before my face.","The men that love and fear Thy name\nShall see their hopes fulfilled;\nThe mighty God will compass them\nWith favor as a shield."],"chorus":""}
