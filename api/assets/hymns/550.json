Every Flower That Grows","verses":["Every flow'r that grows, Every brook that flows,\nTell of beauty God has giv'n for me:\nThroughout my life may beauty be\nDeep within a heart from sin set free.","Gracious Lord above, Looking down in love,\nGuide my thoughts, my life, in my walk with Thee,\nThat day by day the world may see\nChrist, the Lord and Savior, lives in me.","All my earthly days, I shall sing and praise\nGod the Father, Spirit, and Christ the Son.\nGrant faith when life on earth is done,\nI shall sing with those whose rest is won."],"chorus":""}
