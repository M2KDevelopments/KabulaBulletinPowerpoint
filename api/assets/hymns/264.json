{"number":264,"title":"264. O for That Flame of Living Fire","verses":["O for that flame of living fire\nWhich shone so bright in saints of old;\nWhich bade their souls to heaven aspire,\nCalm in distress, in danger bold!","Where is that spirit, Lord, which dwelt\nIn Abram's breast, and sealed him Thine?\nWhich made Paul's heart with sorrow melt,\nAnd glow with energy divine?","That spirit which from age to age\nProclaimed Thy love, and taught Thy ways?\nBrightened Isaiah's vivid page,\nAnd breathed in David's hallowed lays?","Is not Thy grace as mighty now\nAs when Elijah felt its power?\nWhen glory beamed from Moses' brow,\nOr Job endured the trying hour?","Remember, Lord, the ancient days;\nRenew Thy work, Thy grace restore;\nAnd while to Thee our hearts we raise,\nOn us Thy Holy Spirit pour."],"chorus":""}
