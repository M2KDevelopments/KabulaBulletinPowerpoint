{"number":369,"title":"369. Bringing in the Sheaves","verses":["Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,\nSowing in the noontide and the dewy eve;\nWaiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping,\nWe shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.","Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,\nFearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;\nBy and by the harvest, and the labor ended,\nWe shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.","Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,\nThough the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;\nWhen our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome,\nWe shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves."],"chorus":"Bringing in the sheaves, Bringing in the sheaves,\nWe shall come rejoicing, Bringing in the sheaves;\nBringing in the sheaves, Bringing in the sheaves,\nWe shall come rejoicing, Bringing in the sheaves."}
