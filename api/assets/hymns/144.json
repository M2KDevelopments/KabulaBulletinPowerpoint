O Sing a Song of Bethlehem","verses":["O sing a song of Bethlehem,\nOf shepherds watching there,\nAnd of the news that came to them\nFrom angels in the air:\nThe light that shone on Bethlehem\nFills all the world today;\nOf Jesus' birth and peace on earth\nThe angels sing alway.","O sing a song of Nazareth,\nOf sunny days of joy,\nO sing of fragrant flowers breath,\nAnd of the sinless Boy:\nFor now the flowers of Nazareth\nIn every heart may grow;\nNow spreads the fame of His dear name\nOn all the winds that blow.","O sing a song of Calvary,\nIts glory and dismay;\nOf Him who hung upon the tree,\nAnd took our sins away:\nFor He who died on Calvary\nIs risen from the grave;\nAnd Christ, our Lord, by heaven adored,\nIs mighty now to save."],"chorus":""}
