Jesus Son of Blessed Mary","verses":["Jesus, Son of blessed Mary,\nOnce on earth a little child,\nPattern fair of holy living,\nGracious, loving, undefiled:","Though Thy eager heart was yearning\nHeavy laden souls to free,\nYet Thou calledst little children\nIn their happiness to Thee.","Grant that we, like little children,\nFree from pride and guile may be;\nCheerful, trusting, safe, protected\nBy the blessed Trinity."],"chorus":""}
