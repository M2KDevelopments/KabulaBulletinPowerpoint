{"number":329,"title":"329. Take the World, but Give Me Jesus","verses":["Take the world, but give me Jesus;\nAll its joys are but a name,\nBut His love abideth ever,\nThrough eternal years the same.","Take the world, but give me Jesus,\nSweetest comfort of my soul;\nWith my Savior watching o'er me,\nI can sing, though billows roll.","Take the world, but give me Jesus;\nLet me view His constant smile;\nThen throughout my pilgrim journey\nLight will cheer me all the while.","Take the world, but give me Jesus;\nIn His cross my trust shall be,\nTill, with clearer, brighter vision,\nFace to face my Lord I see."],"chorus":"Oh, the height and depth of mercy!\nOh, the length and breadth of love!\nOh, the fullness of redemption,\nPledge of endless life above."}
