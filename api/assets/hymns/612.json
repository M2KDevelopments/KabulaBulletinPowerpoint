Onward, Christian Soldiers!","verses":["Onward, Christian soldiers!\nMarching as to war,\nWith the cross of Jesus\nGoing on before.\nChrist the royal Master,\nLeads against the foe;\nForward into battle,\nSee, His banners go!","Like a mighty army\nMoves the church of God;\nChristians, we are treading\nWhere the saints have trod;\nWe are not divided,\nAll one body we,\nOne in hope and doctrine,\nOne in charity.","Crowns and thrones have perished,\nKingdoms rise and wane,\nBut the church of Jesus\nConstant will remain.\nGates of hell can never\n'Gainst that church prevail;\nWe have Christ's own promise,\nThat can never fail.","Onward, then, ye people!\nJoin our happy throng,\nBlend with ours your voices\nIn the triumph song;\nGlory, praise, and honor\nUnto Christ the King,\nThis through countless ages\nMen and angels sing."],"chorus":"Onward, Christian soldiers!\nMarching as to war,\nWith the cross of Jesus\nGoing on before."}
