{"title":"829. A Noble Wife - Proverbs 31  ","number":829,"verses":["Who can find a virtuous wife?\nFor her worth is far above rubies.","The heart of her husband safely trusts her;\nSo he will have no lack of gain.\nShe does him good and not evil\nAll the days of her life.","She seeks wool and flax,\nAnd willingly works with her hands.\nShe also rises while it is yet night,\nAnd provides food for her house hold,\nAnd a portion for her maidservants.","She girds herself with strength,\nAnd strengthens her arms....\nShe extends her hand to the poor,\nYes, she reaches out her hands to the needy.","Strength and honor are her clothing;\nShe shall rejoice in time to come.\nShe opens her mouth with wisdom,\nAnd on her tongue is the law of kindness.","She watches over the ways of her household,\nAnd does not eat the bread of idleness.\nHer children rise up and call her blessed;\nHer husband also, and he praises her."]}
