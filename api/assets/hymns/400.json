{"number":400,"title":"400. I Come With Joy","verses":["I come with joy to meet my Lord,\nForgiven, loved and free,\nIn awe and wonder to recall\nHis life laid down for me,\nHis life laid down for me.","I come with Christians far and near\nTo find, as all are fed,\r\nOur true community of love\r\nIn Christ's communion bread,\nIn Christ's communion bread.","As Christ breaks bread for us to share\nEach proud division ends.\nThat love that made us makes us one,\nAnd strangers now are friends,\nAnd strangers now are friends.","And thus with joy we meet our Lord.\nHis presence always near,\nIs in such friendship better known:\nWe see and praise Him here,\nWe see and praise Him here.","Together met, together bound,\nWe'll go our diff'rent ways,\nAnd as His people in the world,\nWe'll live and speak His praise,\nWe'll live and speak His praise."],"chorus":""}
