{"number":364,"title":"364. O Jesus Christ, to You","verses":["O Jesus Christ, to You may hymns be rising\nIn every city for Your love and care;\nInspire our worship, grant the glad surprising\nThat Your blest Spirit brings men everywhere.","Grant us new courage, sacrificial, humble,\nStrong in Your strength to venture and to dare,\nTo lift the fallen, guide the feet that stumble,\nSeek out the lonely and God's mercy share.","Show us Your Spirit, brooding o'er each city,\nAs You did weep above Jerusalem,\nSeeking to gather all in love and pity,\nAnd healing those who touch Your garment's hem."],"chorus":""}
