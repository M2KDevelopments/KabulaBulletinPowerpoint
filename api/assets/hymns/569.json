Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior","verses":["Pass me not, O gentle Savior,\nHear my humble cry;\nWhile on others Thou art calling,\nDo not pass me by.","Let me at Thy throne of mercy\nFind a sweet relief;\nKneeling there in deep contrition,\nHelp my unbelief.","Trusting only in Thy merit,\nWould I seek Thy face;\nHeal my wounded, broken spirit,\nSave me by Thy grace.","Thou the spring of all my comfort,\nMore than life for me;\nWhom have I on earth beside Thee?\nWhom in heaven but Thee?"],"chorus":"Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry,\nWhile on others Thou art calling,\nDo not pass me by."}
