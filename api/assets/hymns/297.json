{"number":297,"title":"297. God Be Merciful to Me","verses":["God, be merciful to me,\nOn Thy grace I rest my plea;\nPlenteous in compassion Thou,\nBlot out my transgressions now;\nWash me, make me pure within,\nCleanse, O cleanse me from my sin,\nWash me, make me pure within,\nCleanse, O cleanse me from my sin.","I am evil, born in sin;\nThou desirest truth within.\nThou alone my Savior art,\nTeach Thy wisdom to my heart;\nMake me pure, Thy grace bestow,\nWash me whiter than the snow,\nMake me pure, Thy grace bestow,\nWash me whiter than the snow.","Gracious God, my heart renew,\nMake my spirit right and true;\nCast me not away from Thee,\nLet Thy Spirit dwell in me;\nThy salvation's joy impart,\nSteadfast make my willing heart,\nThy salvation's joy impart,\nSteadfast make my willing heart.","Sinners then shall learn from me\nAnd return, O God, to Thee;\nSavior, all my guilt remove,\nAnd my tongue shall sing Thy love;\nTouch my silent lips, O Lord,\nAnd my mouth shall praise accord,\nTouch my silent lips, O Lord,\nAnd my mouth shall praise accord."],"chorus":""}
