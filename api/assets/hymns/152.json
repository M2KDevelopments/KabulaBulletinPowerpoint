{"number":152,"title":"152. Tell Me the Story of Jesus","verses":["Tell me the story of Jesus,\nWrite on my heart every word,\nTell me the story most precious\nSweetest that ever was heard;\nTell how the angels, in chorus,\nSang as they welcomed His birth,\nGlory to God in the highest,\nPeace and good tidings to earth.","Fasting, alone in the desert,\nTell of the days that He passed,\nHow for our sins He was tempted,\nYet was triumphant at last;\nTell of the years of His labor,\nTell of the sorrow He bore,\nHe was despised and afflicted,\nHomeless, rejected, and poor.","Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,\nWrithing in anguish and pain;\nTell of the grave where they laid Him,\nTell how He liveth again;\nLove in that story so tender,\nClearer than ever I see;\nStay, let me weep while you whisper,\nLove paid the ransom for me."],"chorus":"Tell me the story of Jesus,\nWrite on my heart every word,\nTell me the story most precious,\nSweetest that ever was heard."}
