{"number":130,"title":"130. It Came Upon the Midnight Clear","verses":["It came upon the midnight clear,\nThat glorious song of old,\nFrom angels bending near the earth\nTo touch their harps of gold:\n\"Peace on the earth, good will to men,\nFrom heaven's all-gracious King;\"\nThe world in solemn stillness lay,\nTo hear the angels sing.","Still through the cloven skies they come,\nWith peaceful wings unfurled,\nAnd still their heavenly music floats\nO'er all the weary world;\nAbove its sad and lowly plains\nThey bend on hovering wing,\nAnd ever o'er its Babel sounds\nThe blessed angels sing.","And ye, beneath life's crushing load,\nWhose forms are bending low,\nWho toil along the climbing way\nWith painful steps and slow;\nLook now! for glad and golden hours\nCome swiftly on the wing;\nO rest beside the weary road,\nAnd hear the angels sing."],"chorus":""}
