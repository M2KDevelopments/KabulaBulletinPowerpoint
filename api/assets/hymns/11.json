Great I AM!\nBy earth and heaven confessed;\nI bow and bless the sacred name,\nForever blest.","The God of Abraham praise,\nAt whose supreme command\nFrom earth I rise, and seek the joys\nAt His right hand;\nI all on earth forsake,\nIts wisdom, fame, and power;\nAnd Him my only portion make,\nMy shield and tower.","The whole triumphant host\nGive thanks to God on high;\n\"Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!\"\nThey ever cry;\nHail, Abraham's God and mine!\nI join the heavenly lays;\nAll might and majesty are Thine,\nAnd endless praise."],"chorus":""}
