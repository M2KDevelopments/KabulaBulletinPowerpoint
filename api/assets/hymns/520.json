{"number":520,"title":"520. He Hideth My Soul","verses":["A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,\nA wonderful Savior to me,\nHe hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,\nWhere rivers of pleasure I see.","A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,\nHe taketh my burden away,\nHe holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,\nHe giveth me strength as my day.","With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,\nAnd filled with His fullness divine,\nI sing in my rapture, Oh, glory to God\nFor such a Redeemer as mine.","When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise\nTo meet Him in clouds of the sky,\nHis perfect salvation, His wonderful love,\nI'll shout with the millions on high."],"chorus":"He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock\nThat shadows a dry, thirsty land;\nHe hideth my life in the depths of His love,\nAnd covers me there with His hand,\nAnd covers me there with His hand."}
