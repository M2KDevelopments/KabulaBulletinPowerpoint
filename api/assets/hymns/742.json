{"title":"742. The Lord Works Justice - Psalm 103  ","number":742,"verses":["The Lord works vindication and justice\nfor all who are oppressed.","He made known his ways to Moses,\nhis acts to the people of Israel.","As far as the east is from the west,\nso far does he remove our transgressions from us.","As a father pities his children,\nso the Lord pities those who fear him.\nFor he knows our frame;\nhe remembers that we are dust.","As for man, his days are like grass;\nhe flourishes like a flower of the field;\nfor the wind passes over it,\nand it is gone,\nand its place knows it no more.","But the steadfast love of the Lord\nis from everlasting to everlasting\nupon those who fear him,\nand his righteousness to children's children,\nto those who keep his covenant\nand remember to do his commandments.","The Lord has established his throne\nin the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.","Bless the Lord, O you his angels,\nyou mighty ones who do his word,\nhearkening to the voice of his word!","Bless the Lord, all his hosts,\nhis ministers that do his will!","Bless the Lord, all his works,\nin all places of his dominion.\nBless the Lord, O my soul!"]}
