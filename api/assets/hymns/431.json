{"number":431,"title":"431. Over Yonder","verses":["Come, let us sing of homeland,\nDown by the crystal sea;\nWonderful land where Jesus\nBuildeth a mansion for me.","Water of life there floweth,\nFruit in abundant store;\nCitizens of that country\nHunger and thirst nevermore.","Come go with me to homeland,\nJesus invites you there;\nHelp spread the invitation,\nTell it to men everywhere."],"chorus":"Over yonder, down by the crystal sea,\nOver yonder, There's where I long to be,\nNo more sorrow, toil, grief, nor care,\nIn the homeland bright and fair,\nOver, over there."}
