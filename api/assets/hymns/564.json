For Sunrise Hope and Sunset Calm","verses":["For sunrise hope and sunset calm,\r\nAnd all that lies between,\nFor all the sweetness and the balm\r\nThat is and that has been,\nFor comradeship, for peace in strife,\r\nAnd light on darkened days;\nFor work to do and strength for life\r\nWe sing our hymn of praise.","But O, we press far, far above\nThese gifts of pure delight,\nAnd find in Thee, and in Thy love\nContentment infinite.\nO Lord, beloved, in whom are found\r\nAll joys of time and place,\nWhat will it be when joy is crowned\r\nBy vision of Thy face?"],"chorus":""}
