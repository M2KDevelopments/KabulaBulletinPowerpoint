I Heard the Voice of Jesus","verses":["I heard the voice of Jesus say,\n\"Come unto Me and rest;\nLay down, thou weary one, lay down\nThy head upon My breast.\"\nI came to Jesus as I was,\nWeary and worn and sad;\nI found in Him a resting place,\nAnd He has made me glad.","I heard the voice of Jesus say,\n\"Behold, I freely give\nThe living water; thirsty one,\nStoop down and drink and live.\"\nI came to Jesus, and I drank\nOf that life giving stream;\nMy thirst was quench'd, my soul revived,\nAnd now I live in Him.","I heard the voice of Jesus say,\n\"I am this dark world's light;\nLook unto Me, thy morn shall rise,\nAnd all thy day be bright.\"\nI looked to Jesus, and I found\nIn Him my star, my sun;\nAnd in that light of life I'll walk,\nTill trav'ling days are done."],"chorus":""}
