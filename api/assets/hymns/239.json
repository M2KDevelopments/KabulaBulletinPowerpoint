{"number":239,"title":"239. Jesus, Priceless Treasure","verses":["Jesus, priceless treasure,\nSource of purest pleasure,\nTruest Friend to me:\nAh! how long I've panted,\nAnd my heart has fainted,\nThirsting, Lord, for Thee.\nThine I am, O spotless Lamb,\nI will suffer naught to hide Thee,\nNought I ask beside Thee.","In Thine arm I rest me;\nFoes who would molest me\nCannot reach me here;\nThough the earth be shaking,\nEvery heart be quaking,\nJesus calms my fear;\nSin and hell in conflict fell\nWith their bitter storms assail me:\nJesus will not fail me.","Hence all fears and sadness!\nFor the Lord of gladness,\nJesus enters in;\nThose who love the Father,\nTho' the storms may gather,\nStill have peace within;\nYea, whate'er I here must bear,\nStill in Thee lies purest pleasure,\nJesus, priceless treasure!"],"chorus":""}
