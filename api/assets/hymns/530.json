{"number":530,"title":"530. It Is Well With My Soul","verses":["When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll\nWhatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,\nIt is well, it is well with my soul.","My sin O the joy of this glorious thought\nMy sin, not in part, but the whole,\nIs nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more:\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!","And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,\nThe clouds be roll back as a scroll:\nThe trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend,\n\"Even so\" it is well with my soul."],"chorus":"It is well with my soul,\nIt is well, it is well with my soul."}
