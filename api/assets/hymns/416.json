{"number":416,"title":"416. The Judgment Has Set","verses":["The judgment has set, the books have been opened;\nHow shall we stand in that great day\nWhen every thought, and word, and action,\nGod, the righteous Judge, shall weigh?","The work is begun with those who are sleeping,\nSoon will the living here be tried,\nOut of the books of God's remembrance,\nHis decision to abide.","O, how shall we stand that moment of searching,\nWhen all our sins those books reveal?\nWhen from that court, each case decided,\nShall be granted no appeal?"],"chorus":"How shall we stand in that great day?\nHow shall we stand in that great day?\nShall we be found before Him wanting?\nOr with our sins all washed away?"}
