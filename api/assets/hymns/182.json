{"number":182,"title":"182. Christ Is Alive","verses":["Christ is alive! Let Christians sing.\r\nHis cross stands empty to the sky.\r\nLet streets and homes with praises ring.\r\nHis love in death shall never die.","Christ is alive! No longer bound\r\nTo distant years in Palestine,\r\nHe comes to claim the here and now\r\nAnd conquer every place and time.","In every insult, rift, and war\r\nWhere color, scorn or wealth divide,\r\nHe suffers still, yet loves the more,\r\nAnd lives, though ever crucified.","Christ is alive! Ascended Lord\r\nHe rules the world His Father made,\r\nTill, in the end, His love adored\r\nShall be to all on earth displayed."],"chorus":""}
