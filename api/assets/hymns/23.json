Now the Joyful Bells A-Ringing","verses":["Now the joyful bells a-ring,\nAll ye mountains of the Lord!\nLift our hearts like birds a-winging,\nAll ye mountains, praise the Lord!\nNow our festal season bringing\nKinsmen all to bide and board,\nSets our cheery voices singing:\nAll ye mountains, praise the Lord!","Dear our home as dear none other;\nWhere the mountains praise the Lord!\nGladly here our care we smother;\nWhere the mountains praise the Lord!\nHere we know that Christ our brother\nBinds us all as by a cord:\nHe was born of Mary mother\nWhere the mountains praise the Lord!","Cold the year, new whiteness wearing,\nAll ye mountains, praise the Lord!\nPeace, good will to us a-bearing,\nAll ye mountains praise the Lord!\nNow we all God's goodness sharing\nBreak the bread and sheath the sword:\nBright our hearts the signal flaring,\nAll ye mountains, praise the Lord!"],"chorus":""}
