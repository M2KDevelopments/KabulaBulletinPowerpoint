{"title":"717. The Heavens Declare the Glory of God - Psalm 19  ","number":717,"verses":["The heavens declare the glory of God;\nthe skies proclaim the work of his hands.\nDay after day they pour forth speech;\nnight after night they display knowledge.","There is no speech or language\nwhere their voice is not heard.\nTheir voice goes out into all the earth,\ntheir words to the ends of the world.","In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun,\nwhich is like a bridegroom\ncoming forth from his pavilion,\nlike a champion rejoicing to run his course.","It rises at one end of the heavens\nand makes its circuit to the other;\nnothing is hidden from its heat.","The heavens declare the glory of God;\nthe skies proclaim the work of his hands."]}
