{"number":50,"title":"50. Abide With Me","verses":["Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;\nThe darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!\nWhen other helpers fail, and comforts flee,\nHelp of the helpless, O abide with me!","Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;\nEarth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;\nChange and decay in all around I see;\nO Thou, who changest not, abide with me!","I need Thy presence every passing hour;\nWhat but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?\nWho like Thyself my guide and stay can be?\nThrough cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!","I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;\nIlls have no weight, and tears no bitterness:\nWhere is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?\nI triumph still if Thou abide with me!"],"chorus":""}
