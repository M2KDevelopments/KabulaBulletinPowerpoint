Because He Lives","verses":["God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus,\nHe came to love, heal, and forgive;\nHe lived and died to buy my pardon,\nAn empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.","How sweet to hold a newborn baby,\nAnd feel the pride, and joy He gives;\nBut greater still the calm assurance,\nThis child can face uncertain days because He lives."],"chorus":"Because He lives I can face tomorrow,\nBecause He lives all fear is gone;\nBecause I know He holds the future.\nAnd life is worth the living just because He lives."}
