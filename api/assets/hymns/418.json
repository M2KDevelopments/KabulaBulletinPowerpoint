{"number":418,"title":"418. Day of Judgment, Day of Wonders!","verses":["Day of judgment, day of wonders!\nHark the trumpet's awful sound,\nLouder than a thousand thunders,\nShakes the vast creation round!\nHow the summons, How the summons\nWill the sinner's heart confound!","See the Lord in glory nearing,\nClothed in majesty divine.\nYou who long for His appearing,\nThen shall say, \"This God is mine!\"\nGracious Savior, Gracious Savior,\nOwn me in that day as Thine.","At His call the dead awaken,\nRise to life from earth and sea!\nAll the powers of nature shaken\nBy His looks prepare to flee.\nCareless sinner, Careless sinner,\nWhat will then become of thee?","But to those who have confessed\nLoved and served the Lord below,\nHe will say, \"Come near, ye blessed,\nSee the kingdom I bestow;\nYou forever, You forever\nShall my love and glory know?\""],"chorus":""}
