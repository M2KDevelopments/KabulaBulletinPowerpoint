{"number":452,"title":"452. What Heavenly Music","verses":["What heavenly music steals over the sea!\nEntrancing the senses like sweet melody!\n'Tis the voice of the angels borne soft on the air;\nFor me they are singing; their welcome I hear.","On the banks of old Jordan, here gazing I stand,\nAnd earnestly longing, I stretch forth my hand;\nSend a convoy of angels, dear Jesus, I pray!\nLet me join that sweet music; come, take me away.","Though dark are the waters and rough is the wave,\nIf Jesus permit, the wild surges I'll brave;\nFor that heavenly music hath ravished me so,\nI must join in that chorus! I'll go! let me go!"],"chorus":""}
