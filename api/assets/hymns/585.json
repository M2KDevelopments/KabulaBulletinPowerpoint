{"number":585,"title":"585. When Christ Was Lifted From the Earth","verses":["When Christ was lifted from the earth\nHis arms stretched out above\nThrough every culture, every birth,\nTo draw an answering love.","Still east and west His love extends\nAnd always, near or far,\nHe calls and claims us as His friends\nAnd love us as we are.","Where generation, class or race\nDivides us to our shame\nHe sees not labels but a face,\nA person and a name.","Thus freely loved, tho' fully known\nMay I in Christ be free\nTo welcome and accept His own\nAs Christ accepted me."],"chorus":""}
