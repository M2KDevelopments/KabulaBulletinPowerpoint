Marching to Zion","verses":["Come, we that love the Lord,\nAnd let our joys be known;\nJoin in a song with sweet accord,\nJoin in a song with sweet accord,\nAnd thus surround the throne,\nAnd thus surround the throne.","Let those refuse to sing\nWho never knew our God;\nBut children of the heavenly King,\nBut children of the heavenly King,\nMay speak their joys abroad,\nMay speak their joys abroad.","The hill of Zion yields\nA thousand sacred sweets,\nBefore we reach the heavenly fields,\nBefore we reach the heavenly fields\nOr walk the golden streets,\nOr walk the golden streets.","Then let our songs abound,\nAnd every tear be dry;\nWe're marching through Immanuel's ground,\nWe're marching through Immanuel's ground,\nTo fairer worlds on high,\nTo fairer worlds on high."],"chorus":"We're marching to Zion,\nBeautiful, Beautiful Zion;\nWe're marching upward to Zion,\nThe beautiful city of God."}
