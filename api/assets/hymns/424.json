{"number":424,"title":"424. For Thee, O Dear, Dear Country","verses":["For thee, O dear, dear country,\nMine eyes their vigils keep;\nFor very love beholding\nThy holy name, they weep.\nThe mention of thy glory\nIs unction to the breast,\nAnd medicine in sickness,\nAnd love, and life, and rest.","O one, O only mansion!\nO Paradise of joy!\nWhere tears are ever banish'd\nAnd smiles have no alloy;\nThy loveliness oppresses\nAll human thought and heart,\nAnd none, O Peace, O Sion,\nCan sing thavas thou art.","With jasper glow thy bulwarks,\nThy streets with emeralds blaze;\nThe sardius and the topaz\nUnite in thee their rays;\nThine ageless walls are bonded\nWith amethyst unpriced;\nThe saints shall build thy fabric,\nAnd the cornerstone is Christ.","The cross is all thy splendor,\nThe Crucified thy praise;\nHis laud and benediction\nThy ransom'd saints shall raise;\nUpon the Rock of Ages\nThey build thy holy tower;\nThine is the victor's laurel,\nAnd thine the golden dower.","O sweet and blessed country,\nThe home of God's elect!\nO sweet and blessed country\nThat eager hearts expect!\nJesus, in mercy bring us\nTo that dear land of rest,\nWho art, with God the Father,\nAnd Spirit, ever blest."],"chorus":""}
