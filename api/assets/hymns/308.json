{"number":308,"title":"308. Wholly Thine","verses":["I would be, dear Savior, wholly Thine;\nTeach me how, teach me how;\nI would do Thy will, O Lord, not mine;\nHelp me, help me now.","What is worldly pleasure, wealth, or fame,\nWithout Thee, without Thee?\nI will leave them all for Thy dear name,\nThis my wealth shall be.","As I cast earth's transient joys behind,\nCome Thou near, come Thou near;\nIn Thy presence all in all I find,\n'Tis my comfort here."],"chorus":"Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,\nWholly Thine, this is my vow;\nWholly Thine, wholly Thine,\nWholly Thine, O Lord, just now."}
