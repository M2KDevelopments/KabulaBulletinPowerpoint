Great Is Thy Faithfulness","verses":["Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,\nThere is no shadow of turning with Thee;\nThou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;\nAs Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.","Summer and winter, and springtime and harvest,\nSun, moon, and stars in their courses above,\nJoin with all nature in manifold witness\nTo Thy great faithfulness, mercy, and love.","Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,\nThy own dear presence to cheer and to guide;\nStrength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,\nBlessings all mine, with ten thousand beside."],"chorus":"Great is Thy faithfulness! Great is Thy faithfulness!\nMorning by morning new mercies I see;\nAll I have needed Thy hand hath provided,\nGreat is Thy faithfulness! Lord unto me!"}
