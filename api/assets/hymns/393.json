{"number":393,"title":"393. Lord of the Sabbath","verses":["Lord of the Sabbath and its light,\nI hail Thy hallowed day of rest;\nIt is my weary soul's delight,\nThe solace of my careworn breast,\nThe solace of my careworn breast.","O sacred day of peace and joy,\nThy hours are ever dear to me;\nNe'er may a sinful thought destroy\nThe holy calm I find in thee,\nThe holy calm I find in thee.","How sweetly now they glide along!\nHow hallowed is the calm they yield!\nTransporting is their rapturous song,\nAnd heavenly visions seem revealed,\nAnd heavenly visions seem revealed.","O Jesus, let me ever hail\nThy presence with the day of rest;\nThen will Thy servant never fail\nTo deem Thy Sabbath doubly blest,\nTo deem Thy Sabbath doubly blest."],"chorus":""}
