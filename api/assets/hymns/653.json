Lead Them, My God, to Thee","verses":["Lead them, my God, to Thee,\nLead them to Thee,\nThese children dear of mine,\nThou gavest me;\nO, by Thy love divine,\nLead them, my God, to Thee;\nLead them, my God, to Thee,\nLead them to Thee.","When earth looks bright and fair,\nFestive and gay,\nLet no delusive snare\nLure them astray;\nBut from temptation's power,\nLead them, my God, to Thee;\nLead them, my God, to Thee,\nLead them to Thee.","E'en for such little ones,\nChrist came a child,\nAnd in this world of sin\nLived undefiled.\nO, for His sake, I pray,\nLead them, my God, to Thee;\nLead them, my God, to Thee,\nLead them to Thee.","Yea, though my faith be dim,\nI would believe\nThat Thou this precious gift\nWilt now receive;\nO, take their young hearts now,\nLead them, my God, to Thee;\nLead them, my God, to Thee,\nLead them to Thee."],"chorus":""}
