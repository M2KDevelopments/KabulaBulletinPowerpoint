Forgive Our Sins As We Forgive","verses":["\"Forgive our sins as we forgive,\"\nYou taught us, Lord, to pray;\nBut You alone can grant us grace\nTo live the words we say.","How can Your pardon reach and bless\nThe unforgiving heart\nThat broods on wrongs and will not let\nOld bitterness depart?","In blazing light Your cross reveals\nThe truth we dimly knew:\nHow trifling others' debts to us;\nHow great our debt to You!","Lord, cleanse the depths within our souls\nAnd bid resentment cease;\nThen, by Your mercy reconciled,\nOur lives will spread Your peace."],"chorus":""}
