{"number":101,"title":"101. Children of the Heavenly Father","verses":["Children of the heavenly Father\r\nSafely in His bossom gather;\r\nNestling bird nor star in heaven\r\nSuch a refuge e'er was given.","God His own doth tend and nourish,\r\nIn His holy love they flourish;\r\nFrom all evil things He spares them,\r\nIn His mighty arms He bears them.","Neither life nor death shall ever\r\nFrom the Lord His children sever;\r\nUnto them His grace He showeth,\r\nAnd their sorrows all He knoweth.","Praise the Lord in joyful numbers,\r\nYour Protector never slumbers;\r\nAt the will of your Defender\r\nEvery foeman must surrender.","Though He giveth or He taketh,\r\nGod His children ne'er forsaketh;\r\nHis the loving purpose solely\r\nTo preserve them pure and holy."],"chorus":""}
