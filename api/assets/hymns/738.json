{"title":"738. Our Understanding Priest - Hebrews 2, 4, 6  ","number":738,"verses":["We see Jesus,\nwho was made a little lower than the angels,\nnow crowned with glory and honor\r\nbecause he suffered death,\nso that by the grace of God\nhe might taste death for everyone.","For this reason he had to be made\nlike his brothers in every way,\nin order that he might become a merciful\r\nand faithful high priest in service to God,\nand that he might make atonement for\r\nthe sins of the people.","Because he himself suffered\nwhen he was tempted,\nhe is able to help those\r\nwho are being tempted.","Therefore, since we have a great high priest\nwho has gone through the heavens,\nJesus the Son of God,\nlet us hold firmly to the faith we profess....\nLet us then approach the throne of\ngrace with confidence,\nso that we may receive mercy and\nfind grace to help us in our time of need.","We have this hope as an anchor for\nthe soul, firm and secure."]}
