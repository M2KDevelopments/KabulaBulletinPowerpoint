Arise My Soul Arise","verses":["Arise, my soul, arise!\nStretch forth to things eternal\nAnd hasten to the feet of your Redeemer God.\nThough hid from mortal eyes,\nHe dwells in light supernal;\nYet worship Him in humbleness and call Him Lord.\nHis banquet of love\nAwaits you above;\nYet here He grants a foretaste of the feast to come!\nRejoice, my soul, rejoice,\nTo heav'n lift up your voice:\nAlleluia, alleluia, alleluia!","Now hear the harps of heav'n!\nOh, hear the song victorious,\nThe never-ending anthem sounding through the sky!\nTo mortals is not giv'n\nTo join in strains so glorious;\nYet here on earth we too can sing our praises high!\nHe bought with His blood\nThe ransomed of God;\nTo Him be ever lasting pow'r and victory.\nAnd let the great amen\nResound through heav'n again.\nAlleluia, alleluia, alleluia!"],"chorus":""}
