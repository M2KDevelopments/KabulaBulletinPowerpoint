The Head That Once Was Crowned","verses":["The head that once was crowned with thorns\nIs crowned with glory now;\nA royal diadem adorns\nThe mighty victor's brow.","The highest place that heaven affords\nIs His, is His by right;\nThe King of kings, and Lord of lords,\r\nAnd heaven's eternal light.","The joy of all who dwell above,\nThe joy of all below,\nTo whom He manifests His love,\nAnd grants His name to know.","To them the cross, with all its shame,\nWith all its grace is given;\nTheir name an everlasting name,\nTheir joy the joy of heaven."],"chorus":""}
