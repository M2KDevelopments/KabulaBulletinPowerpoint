Temperance - Titus 2, Proverbs 20, 23, 1 Corinthians 9  ","number":823,"verses":["Teach what befits sound doctrine.\nBid the. older men be temperate, serious,\nsensible, sound in faith, in love,\nand in steadfastness.","Bid the older women likewise\nto be reverent in behavior,\nnot to be slanderers or slaves to drink;\nthey are to teach what is good,\nand so train the young women\r\nto love their husbands and children....\nLikewise urge the younger men\nto control themselves.","Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler;\nand whoever is led astray by it is not wise.","Who has woe? Who has sorrow?\nWho has strife? Who has complaining?\nWho has wounds without cause?\nWho has redness of eyes?\nThose who tarry long over wine,\nthose who go to try mixed wine.","Do not look at wine when it is red,\nwhen it sparkles in the cup\nand goes down smoothly.\nAt the last it bites like a serpent,\nand stings like an adder.","Every athlete exercises self-control in all things.\nThey do it to receive a perishable wreath,\nbut we an imperishable.","For the grace of God has appeared\nfor the salvation of all men,\ntraining us to renounce irreligion\nand worldly passions,\nand to live sober, upright,\nand godly lives in this world,","awaiting our blessed hope,\nthe appearing of the glory\nOf our great God and Savior Jesus Christ."]}
