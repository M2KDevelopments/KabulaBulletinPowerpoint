{"number":655,"title":"655. Happy the Home","verses":["Happy the home when God is there,\nAnd love fills every breast;\nWhen one their wish, and one their prayer,\nAnd one their heavenly rest.","Happy the home where Jesus' name\nIs sweet to every ear;\nWhere children early lisp His fame,\nAnd parents hold Him dear.","Happy the home where prayer is heard,\nAnd praise is wont to rise;\nWhere parents love the Sacred Word\nAnd all its wisdom prize.","Lord, let us in our homes agree\nThis blessed peace to gain;\nUnite our hearts in love to Thee,\nAnd love to all will reign."],"chorus":""}
