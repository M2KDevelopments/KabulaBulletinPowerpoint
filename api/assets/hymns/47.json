God, Who Made the Earth and Heaven","verses":["God, who made the earth and heaven,\nDarkness and light:\nYou the day for work have given,\nFor rest the night.\nMay Your angel guards defend us,\nSlumber sweet Your mercy send us,\nHoly dreams and hopes attend us\nAll through the night.","And when morn again shall call us\nTo run life's way,\nMay we still, whate'er befall us,\nYour will obey.\nFrom the pow'r of evil hide us,\nIn the narrow pathway guide us,\nNever be Your smile denied us\nAll through the day.","Guard us waking, guard us sleeping,\nAnd, when we die,\nMay we in Your mighty keeping\nAll peaceful lie.\nWhen the trumpet call shall wake us,\nThen, O Lord, do not forsake us,\nBut to reign in glory take us\nWith You on high.","Holy Father, throned in heaven,\nAll-holy Son,\nHoly Spirit, freely given,\nBlest Three in One:\nGrant us grace, we now implore You,\nTill we lay our crowns before You\nAnd in worthier strains adore You\nWhile ages run."],"chorus":""}
