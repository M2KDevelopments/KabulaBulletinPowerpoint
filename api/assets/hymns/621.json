{"number":621,"title":"621. Gracious Father, Guard Thy Children","verses":["Gracious Father, guard Thy children\nFrom the foe's destructive power;\nSave, O save them, Lord, from falling\nIn this dark and trying hour.\nThou wilt surely prove Thy people,\nAll our graces must be tried;\nBut Thy word illumes our pathway,\nAnd in God we still confide.","We are in the time of waiting;\nSoon we shall behold our Lord,\nWafted far away from sorrow,\nTo receive our rich reward.\nKeep us, Lord, till Thine appearing,\nPure, unspotted from the world;\nLet Thy Holy Spirit cheer us\nTill Thy banner is unfurled.","With what joyful exultation\nShall the saints Thy banner see,\nWhen the Lord for whom we've waited\nShall proclaim the jubilee!\nFreedom from this world's pollutions;\nFreedom from all sin and pain;\nFreedom from the wiles of Satan,\nAnd from death's destructive reign."],"chorus":""}
