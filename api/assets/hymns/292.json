Jesus, I Come","verses":["Out of my bondage, sorrow and night,\nJesus, I come, Jesus, I come;\nInto Thy freedom, gladness and light,\nJesus, I come to Thee;\nOut of my sickness into Thy health,\nOut of my want and into Thy wealth,\nOut of my sin and into Thyself,\nJesus, I come to Thee.","Out of my shameful failure and loss,\nJesus, I come, Jesus, I come;\nInto the glorious gain of Thy cross,\nJesus, I come to Thee;\nOut of earth's sorrows into Thy balm,\nOut of life's storms and into Thy calm,\nOut of distress to jubilant psalm,\nJesus, I come to Thee.","Out of unrest and arrogant pride,\nJesus, I come, Jesus, I come;\nInto Thy blessed will to abide,\nJesus, I come to Thee;\nOut of myself to dwell in Thy love,\nOut of despair into raptures above,\nUpward for aye on wings like a dove,\nJesus, I come to Thee.","Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,\nJesus, I come, Jesus, I come;\nInto the joy and light of Thy home,\nJesus, I come to Thee;\nOut of the depths of ruin untold,\nInto the peace of Thy sheltering fold,\nEver Thy glorious face to behold,\nJesus, I come to Thee."],"chorus":""}
