As he was going,\nand as they were gazing intently into the sky,\nall at once there stood beside them\ntwo men in white who said,","\"Men of Galilee,\nwhy stand there looking up into the sky?\nThis Jesus, who has been taken away\nfrom you up to heaven,\nwill come in the same way as you\nhave seen him go.\""]}
