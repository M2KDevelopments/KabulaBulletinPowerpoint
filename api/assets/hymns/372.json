{"number":372,"title":"372. How Beauteous Are Their Feet","verses":["How beauteous are their feet\nWho stand on Zion's hill;\nWho bring salvation on their tongues,\nAnd words of peace reveal!","How charming is their voice,\nSo sweet the tidings are:\n\"Zion, behold thy Savior King;\nHe reigns and triumphs here!\"","How happy are our ears,\nThat hear the joyful sound\nWhich kings and prophets waited for,\nAnd sought, but never found!","How blessed are our eyes,\nThat see this heavenly light;\nProphets and kings desired it long,\nBut died without the sight!","The watchmen join their voice,\nAnd tuneful notes employ;\nJerusalem breaks forth in songs,\nAnd deserts learn the joy."],"chorus":""}
