{"number":439,"title":"439. How Far From Home?","verses":["How far from home? I asked, as on\nI bent my steps; the watchman spake:\n\"The long, dark night is almost gone,\nThe morning soon will break.\nThen weep no more, but speed thy flight,\nWith Hope's bright star thy guiding ray,\nTill thou shalt reach the realms of light,\nIn everlasting day.\"","I asked the warrior on the field;\nThis was his soul-inspiring song:\n\"With courage, bold, the sword I'll wield,\nThe battle is not long.\nThen weep no more, but well endure\nThe conflict, till thy work is done;\nFor this we know, the prize is sure,\nWhen victory is won.\"","I asked again; earth, sea, and sun\nSeemed, with one voice, to make reply:\n\"Time's wasting sands are nearly run,\nEternity is nigh.\nThen weep no more; with warning tones,\nPortentous signs are thickening round,\nThe whole creation, waiting, groans,\nTo hear the trumpet sound.\"","Not far from home! O blessed thought!\nThe traveler's lonely heart to cheer;\nWhich oft a healing balm has brought,\nAnd dried the mourner's tear.\nThen weep no more, since we shall meet\nWhere weary footsteps never roam;\nOur trials past, our joys complete,\nSafe in our Father's home."],"chorus":""}
