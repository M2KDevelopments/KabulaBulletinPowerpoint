{"number":503,"title":"503. A Quiet Place","verses":["There is a quiet place,\nFar from the rapid pace where\r\nGod can soothe my troubled mind.\nSheltered by tree and flow'r,\nThere in my quiet hour with Him\nMy cares are left behind.\nWhether a garden small,\nOr on a mountain tall,\nNew strength and courage there I find;\nThen from this quiet place\r\nI go prepared to face a new day\nWith love for all mankind."],"chorus":""}
