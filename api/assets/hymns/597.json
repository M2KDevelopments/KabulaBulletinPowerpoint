Ye Servants of the Lord","verses":["Ye servants of the Lord,\nEach in his office wait;\nObservant of His heavenly word,\nAnd watchful at his gate.","Let all your lamps be bright,\nAnd trim the golden flame;\nGird up your loins as in His sight;\nHis coming thus proclaim.","Watch, 'tis your Lord's command,\nAnd while we speak He's near;\nMark the first signal of His hand,\nAnd ready all appear.","O happy servant, he,\nIn such a posture found!\nHe shall his Lord with rapture see,\nAnd be with honor crowned."],"chorus":""}
