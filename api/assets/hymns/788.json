{"title":"788. Love - 1 Corinthians 13  ","number":788,"verses":["Though I speak with the tongues of men\nand of angels, but have not love,\nI have become as sounding brass\nor a clanging cymbal.","And though I have the gift of prophecy,\nand understand all mysteries\nand all knowledge,\nand though I have all faith,\nso that I could remove mountains,\nbut have not love, I am nothing.","And though I bestow all my goods\nto feed the poor,\nand though I give my body to be burned,\nbut have not love, it profits me nothing.","Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy;\nlove does not parade itself, is not puffed up;","does not behave rudely, does not seek its own,\nis not provoked, thinks no evil;","does not rejoice in iniquity,\nbut rejoices in the truth; bears all things,\nbelieves all things, hopes all things,\nendures all things.","Love never fails.\nBut whether there are prophecies,\nthey will fail;\nwhether there are tongues,\nthey will cease;\nwhether there is knowledge,\nit will vanish away.","For we know in part and we prophesy in part.\nBut when that which is perfect has come,\nthen that which is in part will be done away.","When I was a child,\nI spoke as a child,\nI understood as a child,\nI thought as a child;\nbut when I became a man,\nI put away childish things.","For now we see in a mirror, dimly,\nbut then face to face.\nNow I know in part,\nbut then I shall know just as I also am known.","And now abide faith, hope, love, these three;\nbut the greatest of these is love."]}
