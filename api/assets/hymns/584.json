There's A Spirit in the Air","verses":["There's a Spirit in the air,\nTelling Christians everywhere\n\"Praise the love that Christ revealed,\nLiving, working in our world.\"","Lose your shyness, find your tongue;\nTell the world what God has done:\nGod in Christ has come to stay,\nWe can see His pow'r today.","When believers break the bread\nWhen a hungry child is fed:\nPraise the love that Christ revealed\nLiving, working in our world.","Still His Spirit leads the fight,\nSeeing wrong and setting right:\nGod in Christ has come to stay,\nWe can see His pow'r today.","When a stranger's not a alone,\nWhere the homeless find a home,\nPraise the love that Christ revealed,\nLiving, working in our world."],"chorus":""}
