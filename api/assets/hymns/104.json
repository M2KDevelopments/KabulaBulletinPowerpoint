{"number":104,"title":"104. My Shepherd Will Supply My Need","verses":["My Shepherd will supply my need,\nJehovah is His name.\nIn pastures fresh He makes me feed\nBeside the living stream.\nHe brings my wand'ring spirit back\nWhen I forsake His ways,\nAnd leads me, for His mercy's sake,\nIn paths of truth and grace.","When I walk through the shades of death,\nThy presence is my stay;\nA word of Thy supporting breath\nDrives all my fears away.\nThy hand in sight of all my foes\nDoth still my table spread;\nMy cup with blessings over flows,\nThine oil anoints my head.","The sure provisions of my God\nAttend me all my days;\nO may Thy house be mine abode\nAnd all my work be praise.\nThere would I find a settled rest\nWhile others go and come;\nNo more a stranger or a guest,\nBut like a child at home."],"chorus":""}
