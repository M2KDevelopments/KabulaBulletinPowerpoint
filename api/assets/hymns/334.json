{"number":334,"title":"334. Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing","verses":["Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,\nTune my heart to sing Thy grace;\nStreams of mercy, never ceasing,\nCall for songs of loudest praise.\nTeach me ever to adore Thee,\nMay I still Thy goodness prove,\nWhile the hope of endless glory\nFills my heart with joy and love.","Here I raise my Ebenezer,\nHither by Thy help I've come,\nAnd I hope by Thy good pleasure\nSafely to arrive at home.\nJesus sought me when a stranger,\nWandering from the fold of God;\nHe to rescue me from danger\nInterposed His precious blood.","O, to grace how great a debtor\nDaily I'm constrained to be!\nLet Thy goodness, like a fetter,\nBind me closer still to Thee.\nProne to wander, Lord, I feel it,\nProne to leave the God I love;\nHere's my heart O, take and seal it;\nSeal it for Thy courts above."],"chorus":""}
