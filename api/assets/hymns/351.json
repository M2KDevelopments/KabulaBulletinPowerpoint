Thy Hand, O God Has Guided","verses":["Thy hand, O God, has guided\nThy flock from age to age;\nThe wondrous tale is written\nFull clear on every page;\nOur fathers owned Thy goodness,\nAnd we their deeds record;\nAnd both of this bear witness,\nOne Church, one faith, one Lord.","Thy heralds brought glad tidings\nTo greatest as to least;\nThey bade men rise and hasten\nTo share the great King's feast:\nAnd this was all their teaching,\nIn every deed and word,\nTo all alike proclaiming\nOne Church, one faith, one Lord.","When shadows thick were falling,\nAnd all seemed sunk in night,\nThou, Lord, did send Thy servants,\nThy chosen sons of light.\nOn them and on Thy people\nThy plenteous grace was poured,\nAnd this was still their message:\nOne Church, one faith, one Lord.","Thy mercy will not fail us,\nNor leave Thy work undone;\nWith Thy right hand to help us,\nThe vict'ry shall be won;\nAnd then by men and angels\nThy name shall be adored,\nAnd this shall be their anthem:\nOne Church, one faith, one Lord."],"chorus":""}
