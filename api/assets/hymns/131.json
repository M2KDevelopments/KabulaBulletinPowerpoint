Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming","verses":["Lo, how a rose e'er blooming\nFrom tender stem hath sprung,\nOf Jesse's lineage coming\nAs men of old have sung.\nIt came, a floweret bright,\nAmid the cold of winter,\nWhen half spent was the night.","Isaiah 'twas foretold it,\nThe Rose I have in mind,\nWith Mary we behold it,\nThe virgin mother kind.\nTo show God's love aright\nShe bore to them a Savior.\nWhen half spent was the night."],"chorus":""}
