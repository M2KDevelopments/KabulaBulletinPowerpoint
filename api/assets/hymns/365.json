{"number":365,"title":"365. O Zion, Haste","verses":["O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,\nTo tell to all the world that God is light;\nThat He who made all nations is not willing\nOne soul should perish, lost in shades of night.","Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation\nThat God, in whom they live and move, is love;\nTell how He stooped to save His lost creation,\nAnd died on earth that man might live above.","Give of thy sons to bear the message glorious;\nGive of thy wealth to speed them on their way;\nPour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;\nAnd all thou spendest Jesus will repay.","He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him,\nMake known to every heart His saving grace;\nLet none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,\nThrough thy neglect, unfit to see His face."],"chorus":"Publish glad tidings,\nTidings of peace,\nTidings of Jesus,\nRedemption and release."}
