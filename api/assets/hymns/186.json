{"number":186,"title":"186. I've Found a Friend","verses":["I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!\nHe loved me ere I knew Him;\nHe drew me with the cords of love,\nAnd thus He bound me to Him.\nAnd 'round my heart still closely twine\nThose ties which nought can sever,\nFor I am His, and He is mine,\nForever and forever.","I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!\nHe bled, He died to save me;\nAnd not alone the gift of life,\nBut His own self He gave me.\nNought that I have my own I call,\nI hold it for the Giver;\nMy heart, my strength, my life, my all,\nAre His, and His forever.","I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!\nAll power to Him is given;\nTo guard me on my upward course,\nAnd bring me safe to heaven.\nThe eternal glories gleam afar,\nTo nerve my faint endeavor;\nSo now to watch, to work, to war,\nAnd then to rest forever.","I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!\nSo kind, and true, and tender,\nSo wise a counselor and guide,\nSo mighty a defender.\nFrom Him, who loveth me so well,\nWhat power my soul can sever?\nShall life or death, or earth, or hell?\nNo; I am His forever."],"chorus":""}
