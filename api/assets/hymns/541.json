Lord, Speak to Me","verses":["Lord, speak to me, that I may speak\nIn living echoes of Thy tone;\nAs Thou hast sought, so let me seek\nThy erring children lost and lone.","O lead me, Lord, that I may lead\nThe wandering and the wavering feet;\nO feed me, Lord, that I may feed\nThy hungering ones with manna sweet.","O strengthen me, that while I stand\nFirm on the Rock, and strong in Thee,\nI may stretch out a loving hand\nTo wrestlers with the troubled sea."],"chorus":""}
