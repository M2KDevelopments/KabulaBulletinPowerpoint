{"number":8,"title":"8. We Gather Together","verses":["We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing;\nHe chastens and hastens His will to make known;\nThe wicked oppressing now cease from distressing,\nSing praises to His name; He forgets not His own.","Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining,\nOrdaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;\nSo from the beginning the fight we were winning;\nThou, Lord, wast at our side; all glory be Thine!","We all do extol Thee, Thou Leader triumphant,\nAnd pray that Thou still our Defender wilt be.\nLet Thy congregation escape tribulation;\nThy name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free!"],"chorus":""}
