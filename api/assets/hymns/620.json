{"number":620,"title":"620. On Jordan's Stormy Banks","verses":["On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,\nAnd cast a wishful eye\nTo Canaan's fair and happy land,\nWhere my possessions lie.","O'er all those wide extended plain\nShines one eternal day;\nThere, Christ, the Sun, forever reigns,\nAnd scatters night away.","When shall I reach that happy place,\nAnd be forever blest?\nWhen shall I see my Father's face,\nAnd in His kingdom rest?","Filled with delight, my raptured soul\nWould here no longer stay;\nThough Jordan's waves around me roll,\nFearless I'd launch away."],"chorus":"I am bound for the promised land,\nI am bound for the promised land;\nO who will come and go with me?\nI am bound for the promised land."}
