{"number":467,"title":"467. Life Is Great! So Sing About It","verses":["Life is great! So sing about it,\nAs we can and as we should-\nShop and buses, towns and people,\nVillage, farmland, field and wood,\nLife is great and life is given;\nLife is lovely, free and good.","Life is great!- what ever happens,\nSnow or sunshine, joy or pain,\nHardship, grief or disillusion,\nSuffering that I can't explain-\nLife is great if someone loves me,\nHolds my hand and calls my name.","Love is great!- the love of lovers,\nWhispered words and longing eyes;\nLove that gazes at the cradle\nWhere a child of loving lies;\nLove that lasts when youth has faded,\nBends with age, but never dies.","Love is giving and receiving-\nBoy and girl, or friend with friend;\nLove is bearing and forgiving\nAll the hurts that hate can send;\nLove's the greatest way of living,\nHoping, trusting to the end.","God is great! in Christ He loved us,\r\nAs we should, but never can-\nLove that suffered, hoped and trusted\nWhen disciples turned and ran,\nLove that broke through death forever.\nPraise that loving, living Man!"],"chorus":""}
