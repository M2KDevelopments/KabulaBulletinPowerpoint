{"number":645,"title":"645. God of Our Fathers","verses":["God of our fathers, whose almighty hand\nLeads forth in beauty all the starry band\nOf shining worlds in splendor through the skies,\nOur grateful songs before Thy throne arise.","Thy love divine hath led us in the past,\nIn this free land by Thee our lot is cast;\nBe Thou our ruler, guardian, guide, and stay,\nThy word our law, Thy paths our chosen way.","From war's alarms, from deadly pestilence,\nBe Thy strong arm our ever sure defense;\nThy true religion in our hearts increase,\nThy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace.","Refresh Thy people on their toilsome way,\nLead us from night to never-ending day;\nFill all our lives with love and grace divine,\nAnd glory, laud, and praise be ever Thine."],"chorus":""}
