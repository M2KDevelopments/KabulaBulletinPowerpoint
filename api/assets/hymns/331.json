O Jesus I Have Promised","verses":["O Jesus, I have promised to serve thee to the end;\r\nbe thou forever near me, my Master and my friend.\r\nI shall not fear the battle if thou art by my side,\r\nnor wander from the pathway if thou wilt be my guide.","O let me feel thee near me! The world is ever near;\r\nI see the sights that dazzle, the tempting sounds I hear;\r\nmy foes are ever near me, around me and within;\r\nbut Jesus, draw thou nearer, and shield my soul from sin.","O Jesus, thou hast promised to all who follow thee\r\nthat where thou art in glory there shall thy servant be.\nAnd Jesus, I have promised to serve thee to the end;\r\nO give me grace to follow, my Master and my Friend."],"chorus":""}
