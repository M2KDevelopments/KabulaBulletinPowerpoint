{"number":410,"title":"410. Thy Broken Body Gracious Lord","verses":["Thy broken body, gracious Lord,\nIs shadowed by this broken bread;\nThe wine which in this cup is poured,\nPoints to the blood which Thou hast shed.","And while we meet together thus,\nWe show that we are one in Thee;\nThy precious blood was shed for us,\nThy death, O Lord, hast set us free!","We have one hope that Thou wilt come,\nThee in the air we wait to see;\nWhen Thou wilt give Thy saints a home,\nAnd we shall ever reign with Thee."],"chorus":""}
