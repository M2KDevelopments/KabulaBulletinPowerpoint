As With Gladness Men of Old","verses":["As with gladness, men of old\r\nDid the guiding star behold\r\nAs with joy they hailed its light\r\nLeading onward, beaming bright\r\nSo, most glorious Lord, may we\r\nEvermore be led to Thee.","As with joyful steps they sped\r\nTo that lowly manger bed\r\nThere to bend the knee before\r\nHim Whom heav'n and earth adore;\r\nSo may we with willing feet\r\nEver seek Thy mercy seat.","As they offered gifts most rare\r\nAt that manger rude and bare;\r\nSo may we with holy joy,\r\nPure and free from sin's alloy,\r\nAll our costliest treasures bring,\r\nChrist, to Thee, our heavenly King.","Holy Jesus, every day\r\nKeep us in the narrow way;\r\nAnd, when earthly things are past,\r\nBring our ransomed souls at last\r\nWhere they need no star to guide,\r\nWhere no clouds Thy glory hide."],"chorus":""}
