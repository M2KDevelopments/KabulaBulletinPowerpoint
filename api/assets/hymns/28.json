Praise We the Lord","verses":["Praise we the Lord, who made all beauty\nFor all our senses to enjoy;\nOwe we our humble thanks and duty\nThat simple pleasures never cloy;\nPraise we the Lord, who made all beauty\nFor all our senses to enjoy.","Praise Him who loves to see young lovers,\nFresh hearts that swell with youthful pride;\nThank Him who sends the sun above us,\nAs bridegroom fit to meet his bride;\nPraise Him who loves to see young lovers,\nFresh hearts that swell with youthful pride.","Praise Him who by a simple flower\r\nLifts up our hearts to things above;\nThank Him who gives to each one power\nTo find a friend to know and love;\nPraise Him who by a simple flower\nLifts up our hearts to things above."],"chorus":""}
