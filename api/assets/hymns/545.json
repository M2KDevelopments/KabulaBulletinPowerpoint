Savior, Like a Shepherd","verses":["Savior, like a Shepherd lead us,\nMuch we need Thy tenderest care;\nIn Thy pleasant pastures feed us,\nFor our use Thy folds prepare.\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\nThou hast bought us, Thine we are;\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\nThou hast bought us, Thine we are.","We are Thine; do Thou befriend us,\nBe the Guardian of our way;\nKeep Thy flock, from sin defend us,\nSeek us when we go astray.\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\nHear, O hear us, when we pray!\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\nHear, O hear us, when we pray!","Thou hast promised to receive us,\nPoor and sinful though we be;\nThou hast mercy to relieve us,\nGrace to cleanse, and power to free.\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\nWe will early turn to Thee;\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\nWe will early turn to Thee."],"chorus":""}
