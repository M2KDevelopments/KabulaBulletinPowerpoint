{"number":271,"title":"271. Break Thou the Bread of Life","verses":["Break Thou the bread of life, Dear Lord, to me,\nAs Thou didst break the loaves Beside the sea;\nBeyond the sacred page I seek Thee, Lord;\nMy spirit pants for Thee, O living Word.","Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord, To me, to me,\nAs Thou didst bless the bread By Galilee;\nThen shall all bondage cease, All fetters fall;\nAnd I shall find my peace, My all in all.","Thou art the bread of life, O Lord, to me;\nThy holy Word the truth That saveth me;\nGive me to eat and live With Thee above;\nTeach me to love Thy truth, For Thou art love.","Spirit and life are they, Words Thou dost speak;\nI hasten to obey, But I am weak;\nThou art my only help, Thou art my life;\nHeeding Thy holy Word I win the strife."],"chorus":""}
