O God, Unseen, Yet Ever Near","verses":["O God, unseen, yet ever near,\nReveal Thy presence now\nWhile we in love that hath no fear,\nBefore Thy glory bow.","Here may Thy faithful people know\nThe blessings of Thy love,\nThe streams that thro' the desert flow,\nThe manna from above.","We come, obedient to Thy Word\nTo feast on heav'nly food,\nOur meat, the body of our Lord,\nOur drink, His precious blood.","Thus may we all Thy words obey,\nFor we, O God, are Thine,\nAnd go rejoicing on our way,\nRenewed by strength divine."],"chorus":""}
