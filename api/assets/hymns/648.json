{"number":648,"title":"648. I Vow to Thee, My Country","verses":["I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above,\nEntire and whole and perfect, the service of my love:\nThe love that asks the reason the love that stands the test,\nThat lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;\nThe love that never falters, the love that pays the price,\nThe love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.","And there's another country, I've heard of long ago,\nMost dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;\nWe may not count her armies, we may not see her King;\nHer fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;\nAnd one by one and fervently we pray for her increase,\nAnd her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peace."],"chorus":""}
