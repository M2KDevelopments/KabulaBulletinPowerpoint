{"number":3,"title":"3. God Himself Is With Us","verses":["God Himself is with us;\nLet us all adore Him,\nAnd with awe appear before Him.\nGod is here within us;\nSoul, in silence fear him,\nHumbly, fervently draw near Him.\nNow His own who have known God,\nin worship lowly,\r\nYield their spirits wholly.","Come, abide within me;\nLet my soul, like Mary,\nBe Thine earthly sanctuary.\nCome, in-dwelling Spirit,\nWith transfigured splendor;\nLove and honor will I render.\nWhere I go here below,\nLet me bow before Thee,\nKnow Thee and adore Thee.","Gladly we surrender\nEarth's deceitful treasures,\nPride of life and sinful pleasures:\nGladly, Lord, we offer\nThine to be forever,\nSoul and life and each endeavor.\nThou alone shalt be known\nLord of all our being,\nLife's true way decreeing."],"chorus":""}
