{"number":110,"title":"110. God's Free Mercy Streameth","verses":["God's free mercy streameth\nOver all the world,\nAnd His banner gleameth,\nBy His church unfurled;\nBroad and deep and glorious,\nAs the heaven above,\nShines in might victorious\nHis eternal love.","Summer suns are glowing\nOver land and sea;\nHappy light is flowing,\nBountiful and free;\nEverything rejoices\nIn the mellow rays;\nEarth's ten thousand voices\nSwell the psalm of praise.","Lord, upon our blindness\nThy pure radiance pour;\nFor Thy loving kindness\nWe would love Thee more;\nAnd when clouds are drifting\nDark across the sky,\nThen, the veil uplifting,\nFather, be Thou nigh.","We will never doubt Thee,\nTho' Thou veil Thy light;\nLife is dark without Thee,\nDeath with Thee is bright.\nLight of light, shine o'er us\nOn our pilgrim way,\nGo Thou still before us\nTo the endless day."],"chorus":""}
