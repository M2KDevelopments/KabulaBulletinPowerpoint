{"number":83,"title":"83. O Worship the King","verses":["O worship the King, all glorious above,\nO gratefully sing His wonderful love;\nOur shield and defender, the Ancient of days,\nPavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.","O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,\nWhose robe is the light, whose canopy space;\nHis chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,\nAnd dark is His path on the wings of the storm.","Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?\nIt breathes in the air, it shines in the light;\nIt streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,\nAnd sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.","Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,\nIn Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail;\nThy mercies, how tender! how firm to the end!\nOur Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!"],"chorus":""}
