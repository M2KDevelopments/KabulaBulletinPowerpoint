{"number":551,"title":"551. Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me","verses":["Jesus, Savior, pilot me\nOver life's tempestuous sea;\nUnknown waves before me roll,\nHiding rock and treacherous shoal,\nChart and compass come from Thee;\nJesus, Savior, pilot me.","As a mother stills her child,\nThou canst hush the ocean wild;\nBoisterous waves obey Thy will\nWhen Thou sayest to them, \"Be still.\"\nWondrous Sovereign of the sea,\nJesus, Savior, pilot me.","When at last I near the shore,\nAnd the fearful breakers roar\n'Twixt me and the peaceful rest,\nThen, while leaning on Thy breast,\nMay I hear Thee say to me,\n\"Fear not, I will pilot thee.\""],"chorus":""}
