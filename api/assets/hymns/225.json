{"number":225,"title":"225. God Is Working His Purpose Out","verses":["God is working His purpose out\nAs year suceeds to year;\nGod is working His purpose out,\nAnd the time is drawing near;\nNearer and nearer draws the time,\nThe time that shall surely be\nWhen the earth shall be filled with the glory of God\nAs the waters cover the sea.","From utmost east to utmost west,\nWhere'er man's foot hath trod,\nBy the mouth of many messengers\nGoes forth the voice of God;\nGive ear to me, ye confinents,\nYe isles, give ear to me,\nThat the earth shall be filled with the glory of God\nAs the waters cover the sea.","March we forth in the strength of God\nWith the banner of Christ unfurled,\nThat the light of the glorious gospel of truth\nMay shine thru-out the world:\nFight we the fight with sorrow and sin\nTo set their captives free,\nThat the earth shall be filled with the glory of God\nAs the waters cover the sea.","All we can do is nothing worth\nUnless God blesses the deed;\nVainly we hope for the harvest tide\nTill God gives life to the seed;\nYet nearer and nearer draws the time,\nThe time that shall surely be,\nWhen the earth shall be filled with the glory of God\nAs the waters cover the sea."],"chorus":""}
