{"number":371,"title":"371. Lift Him Up","verses":["Lift Him up, 'tis He that bids you,\nLet the dying look and live;\nTo all weary, thirsting sinners,\nLiving waters will He give;\nAnd though once so meek and lowly,\nYet the Prince of heaven was He;\nAnd the blind, who grope in darkness,\nThrough the blood of Christ shall see.","Lift Him up, this precious Savior,\nLet the multitude behold\nThey with willing hearts shall seek Him,\nHe will draw them to His fold;\nThey shall gather from the wayside,\nHastening on with joyous feet,\nThey shall bear the cross of Jesus,\nAnd shall find salvation sweet.","Lift Him up in all His glory,\n'Tis the Son of God on high;\nLift Him up, His love shall draw them,\nE'en the careless shall draw nigh;\nLet them hear again the story\nOf the cross, the death of shame;\nAnd from tongue to tongue repeat it;\nMighty throngs shall bless His name.","O then lift Him up in singing,\nLift the Savior up in prayer;\nHe, the glorious Redeemer,\nAll the sins of men did bear,\nYes, the young shall bow before Him,\nAnd the old their voices raise;\nAll the deaf shall hear hosannah;\nAnd the dumb shall shout His praise."],"chorus":"Lift Him up, the risen Savior,\nHigh amid the waiting throng;\nLift Him up, 'tis He that speaketh,\nNow He bids you flee from wrong."}
