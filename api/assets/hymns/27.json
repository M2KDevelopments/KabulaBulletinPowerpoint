{"number":27,"title":"27. Rejoice, Ye Pure in Heart!","verses":["Rejoice, ye pure in heart!\nRejoice, give thanks, and sing;\nYour festal banner wave on high,\nThe cross of Christ your King.","With voice as full and strong\nAs ocean's surging praise,\nSend forth the sturdy hymns of old,\nThe psalms of ancient days.","With all the angel choirs,\nWith all the saints on earth\nPour out the strains of joy and bliss,\nTrue rapture, noblest mirth.","Yes, on through life's long path,\nStill chanting as ye go;\nFrom youth to age, by night and day,\nIn gladness and in woe.","Praise Him who reigns on high,\nThe Lord whom we adore\nThe Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\nOne God forevermore."],"chorus":"Rejoice! Rejoice!\nRejoice, give thanks, and sing!"}
