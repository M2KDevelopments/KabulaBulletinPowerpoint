{"number":368,"title":"368. Watchman, Blow the Gospel Trumpet","verses":["Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,\nEvery soul a warning give;\nWhosoever hears the message\nMay repent, and turn and live.","Sound it loud o'er every hilltop,\nGloomy shade and sunny plain;\nOcean depths repeat the message,\nFull salvation's glad refrain.","Sound it in the hedge and highway,\nEarth's dark spots where exiles roam;\nLet it tell all things are ready,\nFather waits to welcome home.","Sound it for the heavy laden,\nWeary, longing to be free;\nSound a Savior's invitation,\nSweetly saying, \"Come to me.\""],"chorus":"Blow the trumpet, trusty watchman,\nBlow it loud o'er land and sea;\nGod commissions, sound the message!\nEvery captive may be free."}
