{"title":"800. Union with Christ - John 15  ","number":800,"verses":["\"I am the true vine,\nand My Father is the vinedresser.","\"Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit,\nHe takes away;\nand every branch that bears fruit,\nHe prunes it, that it may bear more fruit.","\"You are already clean because of\nthe word which I have spoken to you.","\"Abide in Me, and I in you.\nAs the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,\nunless it abides in the vine,\nso neither can you,\nunless you abide in Me.","\"I am the vine, you are the branches;\nhe who abides in Me, and I in him,\nhe bears much fruit;\nfor apart from Me you can do nothing.","\"If anyone does not abide in Me,\nhe is thrown away as a branch, and dries up;\nand they gather them,\nand cast them into the fire,\nand they are burned.","\"If you abide in Me,\nand My words abide in you,\nask whatever you wish,\nand it shall be done for you.","\"By this is My Father glorified,\nthat you bear much fruit,\nand so prove to be My disciples.","\"Just as the Father has loved Me,\nI have also loved you; abide in My love.","\"If you keep My commandments,\nyou will abide in My love;\njust as I have kept My Father's commandments,\nand abide in His love.\""]}
