Holy Spirit, Light Divine","verses":["Holy Spirit, light divine,\nShine upon this heart of mine,\nChase the shades of night away,\nTurn my darkness into day.","Holy Spirit, power divine,\nCleanse this guilty heart of mine;\nLong has sin, without control,\nHeld dominion o'er my soul.","Holy Ghost, with joy divine,\nCheer this saddened heart of mine,\nBid my many woes depart,\nHeal my wounded, bleeding heart.","Holy Spirit, all divine,\nDwell within this heart of mine,\nCast down every idol throne,\nReign supreme, and reign alone."],"chorus":""}
