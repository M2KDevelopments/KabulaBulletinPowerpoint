Give to the Winds Your Fears","verses":["Give to the winds your fears;\nIn hope be undismayed:\nGod hears your sighs and counts your tears,\nGod shall lift up your head.","To Him commit your griefs;\nYour ways put in His hands\nTo His sure truth and tender care\nWho earth and heaven commands.","O put your trust in God;\nIn duty's path go on.\nWalk in His strength with faith and hope,\nSo shall your work be done.","Leave to His sovereign sway\nTo choose and to command;\nSo you shall, faithful, seek His way\nHow wise, how strong His hand!"],"chorus":""}
