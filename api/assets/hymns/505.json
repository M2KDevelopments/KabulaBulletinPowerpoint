{"number":505,"title":"505. I Need the Prayers","verses":["I need the prayers of those I love,\nWhile trav'ling o'er life's rugged way,\nThat I may true and faithful be,\nAnd live for Jesus every day.","I need the prayers of those I love,\nTo help me in each trying hour,\nTo bear my tempted soul to Him,\nThat He may keep me by His pow'r.","I want my friends to pray for me,\nTo hold me up on wings of faith,\nThat I may walk the narrow way,\nKept by our Father's glorious grace."],"chorus":"I want my friends to pray for me,\nTo bear my tempted soul above,\nAnd intercede with God for me;\nI need the prayers of those I love."}
