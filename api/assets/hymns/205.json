{"number":205,"title":"205. Gleams of the Golden Morning","verses":["The golden morning is fast approaching;\nJesus soon will come\nTo take His faithful and happy children\nTo their promised home.","The gospel summons will soon be carried\nTo the nations round;\nThe Bridegroom then will cease to tarry\nAnd the trumpet sound.","Attended by all the shining angels,\nDown the flaming sky\nThe Judge will come, and will take His people\nWhere they will not die.","There those loved ones who have long been parted,\nWill all meet that day;\nThe tears of those who are broken-hearted\nWill be wiped away."],"chorus":"O, we see the gleams of the golden morning\nPiercing through this night of gloom!\nO, we see the gleams of the golden morning\nThat will burst the tomb."}
