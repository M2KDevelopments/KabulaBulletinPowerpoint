This Is My Will","verses":["This is My will, My one command,\nThat love should dwell among you all.\nThis is My will that you should love\nAs I have shown that I love you.","No greater love a man can have\nThan that he die to save his friends.\nYou are My friends if you obey\nWhat I command that you should do.","You chose not Me, but I chose you\nThat you should go and bear much fruit.\nI chose you out that you in Me\nShould bear much fruit that will abide.","All that I ask My Father, dear,\nFor My name's sake you shall receive.\nThis is My will, My one command,\nThat love should dwell in each, in all."],"chorus":""}
