Now Thank We All Our God","verses":["Now thank we all our God\nWith heart and hands and voices,\nWho wondrous things hath done,\nIn whom His world rejoices;\nWho, from our mothers' arms\nHath blessed us on our way\nWith countless gifts of love,\nAnd still is ours today.","O may this bounteous God\nThrough all our life be near us,\nWith ever joyful hearts\nAnd blessed peace to cheer us;\nAnd keep us in His grace,\nAnd guide us when perplexed,\nAnd free us from all ills\nIn this world and the next.","All praise and thanks to God,\nThe Father, now be given,\nThe Son, and Him who reigns\nWith them in highest heaven,\nThe one eternal God,\nWhom earth and heaven adore;\nFor thus it was, is now,\nAnd shall be evermore."],"chorus":""}
