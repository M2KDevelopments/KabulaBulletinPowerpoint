{"number":487,"title":"487. In the Garden","verses":["I come to the garden alone,\nWhile the dew is still on the roses;\nAnd the voice I hear, falling on my ear,\nThe Son of God discloses.","He speaks, and the sound of His voice\nIs so sweet the birds hush their singing,\nAnd the melody that He gave to me\nWithin my heart is ringing.","I'd stay in the garden with Him\nThough the night around me be falling,\nBut He bids me go; through the voice of woe,\nHis voice to me is calling."],"chorus":"And He walks with me, and He talks with me,\nAnd He tells me I am His own;\nAnd the joy we share as we tarry there,\nNone other has ever known."}
