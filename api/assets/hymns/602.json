{"number":602,"title":"602. O Brother, Be Faithful","verses":["O brother, be faithful! soon Jesus will come,\nFor whom we have waited so long;\nO, soon we shall enter our glorious home,\nAnd join in the conqueror's song.\nO brother, be faithful! for why should we prove\nUnfaithful to Him who hath shown\nSuch deep, such unbounded and infinite love;\nWho died to redeem us His own.","O brother, be faithful! the city of gold,\nPrepared for the good and the blest,\nIs waiting its portals of pearl to unfold,\nAnd welcome thee into thy rest.\nThen, brother, prove faithful! not long shall we stay\nIn weariness here, and forlorn,\nTime's dark night of sorrow is wearing away,\nWe haste to the glorious morn.","O brother, be faithful! He soon will descend,\nCreation's omnipotent King,\nWhile legions of angels His chariot attend,\nAnd palm wreaths, of victory bring.\nO brother, be faithful! and soon shalt thou hear\nThy Savior pronounce the glad word,\nWell done, faithful servant, thy title is clear,\nTo enter the joy of thy Lord.","O brother be faithful! eternity's years\nShall tell for thy faithfulness now,\nWhen bright smiles of gladness shall scatter thy tears,\nA coronet gleam on thy brow.\nO brother, be faithful! the promise is sure,\nThat waits for the faithful and tried;\nTo reign with the ransomed, immortal and pure,\nAnd ever with Jesus abide."],"chorus":""}
