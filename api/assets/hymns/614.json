{"number":614,"title":"614. Sound the Battle Cry","verses":["Sound the battle cry, See! the foe is nigh;\nRaise the standard high For the Lord;\nGird your armor on, Stand firm, every one,\nRest your cause upon His holy word.","Strong to meet the foe, Marching on we go,\nWhile our cause we know Must prevail;\nShield and banner bright, Gleaming in the light,\nBattling for the right, We ne'er can fail.","O Thou God of all, Hear us when we call,\nHelp us, one and all, By Thy grace;\nWhen the battle's done, And the victory won,\nMay we wear the crown Before Thy face."],"chorus":"Rouse, then, soldiers! rally round the banner!\nReady, steady, pass the word along;\nOnward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!\nChrist is Captain of the mighty throng."}
