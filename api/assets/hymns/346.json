{"number":346,"title":"346. Lord Who Dost Give to Thy Church","verses":["Lord, who dost give to Thy church for its healing\nGifts, and the grace to sustain and renew,\nHear as we pray that today and each morrow\nWe to Thy purpose may show ourselves true.","Clear be the voices of preachers and prophets\nFearlessly speaking the word of the Lord,\nWord of redemption thro' God's Son incarnate,\nBlessing for cursing, and peace for the sword.","Tender and wise be the hearts of the pastors,\nGuiding and guarding the souls in their care,\nFirm with the wayward, a strength to the doubting,\nHelping the needy their burdens to bear.","May those who teach grow in knowledge and patience,\nGuiding to wisdom the young and the old,\nTraining for worship and witness and service,\nFoes to all falsehood, in truthfulness bold.","Lord, ever give to us gifts in due measure,\nEach needing other, and all having worth;\nSo to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit,\nGlory be shown by the church here on earth."],"chorus":""}
