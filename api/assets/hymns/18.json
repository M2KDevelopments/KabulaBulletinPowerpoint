O Morning Star How Fair and Bright","verses":["O Morning Star, how fair and bright!\nYou shine with God's own truth and light,\nAglow with grace and mercy!\nOf Jacob's race, King David's Son,\nOur Lord and Master, You have won\r\nOur hearts to serve You only!\nLowly, Holy!\r\nGreat and glorious, all victorious,\nRich in blessing!\nRule and might o'er all possessing!","Lord, when You look on us in love,\nAt once there falls from God above\nA ray of purest pleasure.\nYour Word and Spirit, flesh and blood\nRefresh our souls with heav'nly food.\nYou are our dearest treasure!\nLet Your mercy warm and cheer us!\r\nO draw near us! For You teach us\nGod's own love through You has reached us.","Almighty Father, in Your Son\nYou loved us, when not yet begun\nWas this old earth's foundation!\nYour Son has ransomed us in love\nTo live in Him here and above:\nThis is Your great salvation.\nAlleluia! Christ the living,\nTo us giving life forever,\nKeeps us Yours and fails us never!","O let the harps break forth in sound!\nOur joy be all with music crowned,\nOur voices gaily blending!\nFor Christ goes with us all the way -\nToday, tomorrow, every day!\nHis love is never ending!\nSing out! Ring out!\nJubilation! Exultation!\nTell the story!\nGreat is He, the King of glory!"],"chorus":""}
