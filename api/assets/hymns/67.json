O Lord Now Let Your Servant","verses":["O Lord, now let Your servant\r\nDepart in heav'nly peace,\nFor I have seen the glory\r\nOf Your redeeming grace:\nA light to lead the Gentiles\nUnto Your holy hill,\nThe glory of Your people,\nYour chosen Israel.","Then grant that I may follow\nYour gleam, O glorious Light,\r\nTill earthly shadows scatter,\nAnd faith is changed to sight;\nTill raptured saints shall gather\nUpon that shining shore,\nWhere Christ, the blessed Daystar,\nShall light them evermore."],"chorus":""}
