Love Consecrates the Humblest Act","verses":["Love consecrates the humblest act\nAnd haloes mercy's deeds;\nIt sheds a benediction sweet\nAnd hallows human needs.","When in the shadow of the cross\nChrist knelt and washed the feet\nOf His disciples, He gave us\nA sign of love complete.","Love serves and willing, stoops to serve;\nWhat Christ in love so true\nHas freely done for one and all,\nLet us now gladly do!"],"chorus":""}
