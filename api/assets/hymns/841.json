The Plan of Salvation - Ephesians 1  ","number":841,"verses":["Blessed be God the Father of our\nLord Jesus Christ,\nwho has blessed us with all the\nspiritual blessings of heaven in Christ.","Before the world was made,\nhe chose us, chose us in Christ,\nto be holy and spotless,\nand to live through love in his presence,\ndetermining that we should become\nhis adopted sons, through Jesus Christ\nfor his own kind purposes,\nto make us praise the glory of his grace,\nhis free gift to us in the Beloved,\nin whom, through his blood,\nwe gain our freedom, the forgiveness of our sins.","Such is the richness of the grace\r\nwhich he has showered on us\nin all wisdom and insight.","He has let us know the mystery of his purpose,\nthe hidden plan he so kindly made in Christ\nfrom the beginning to act upon\nwhen the times had run their course to the end:\nthat he would bring everything\ntogether under Christ, as head,\neverything in the heavens and\neverything on earth.","And it is in him that we were claimed as God's own,\nchosen from the beginning,\nunder the predetermined plan of the one\nwho guides all things as he decides by his own will;\nchosen to be, for his greater glory,\nthe people who would put their\nhopes in Christ before he came.","Now you too, in him, have heard the message\nof the truth and the good news of your salvation,\nand have believed it;\nand you too have been stamped with the seal\nof the Holy Spirit of the Promise,\nthe pledge of our inheritance which brings freedom\nfor those whom God has taken for his own,\nto make his glory praised."]}
