I Would Be Like Jesus","verses":["Earthly pleasures vainly call me;\nI would be like Jesus;\nNothing worldly shall enthrall me;\nI would be like Jesus.","He has broken every fetter,\nI would be like Jesus;\nThat my soul may serve Him better,\nI would be like Jesus.","All the way from earth to glory,\nI would be like Jesus;\nTelling o'er and o'er the story,\nI would be like Jesus.","That in heaven He may meet me,\nI would be like Jesus;\nThat His words \"Well done\" may greet me,\nI would be like Jesus."],"chorus":"Be like Jesus, this my song,\nIn the home and in the throng,\nBe like Jesus, all day long!\nI would be like Jesus."}
