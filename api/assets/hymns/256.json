Ye Servants of God","verses":["Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,\nAnd publish abroad His wonderful name;\nThe name all victorious of Jesus extol;\nHis kingdom is glorious, He rules over all.","God ruleth on high, almighty to save;\nAnd still He is nigh His presence we have;\nThe great congregation His triumph shall sing,\nAscribing salvation to Jesus our King.","\"Salvation to God, Who sits on the throne,\"\nLet all cry aloud, and honor the Son;\nThe praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,\nFall down on their faces, and worship the Lamb.","Then let us adore, and give Him His right,\nAll glory and power, all wisdom and might,\nAll honor and blessing, with angels above,\nAnd thanks never ceasing, for infinite love."],"chorus":""}
