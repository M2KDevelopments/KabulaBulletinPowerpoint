What wondrous love is this\nThat caused the Lord of bliss\nTo bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul;\nTo bear the dreadful curse for my soul","To God and to the Lamb I will sing,\nI will sing; To God and to the Lamb,\nI will sing; To God and to the Lamb\nWho is the great I am,\nWhile millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing;\nWhile millions join the theme, I will sing.","And when from death I'm free,\nI'll sing on, I'll sing on;\nAnd when from death I'm free, I'll sing on;\nAnd when from death I'm free,\r\nI'll sing and joyful be,\nAnd through eternity I'll sing on, I'll sing on!\nAnd through eternity, I'll sing on"],"chorus":""}
