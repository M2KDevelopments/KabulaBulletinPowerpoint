{"number":177,"title":"177. Jesus, Your Blood and Righteousness","verses":["Jesus, Your blood and righteousness\nMy beauty are, my glorious dress;\nMid flaming worlds, in these arrayed,\nWith joy shall I lift up my head.","Bold shall I stand in that great day,\nCleansed and redeemed, no debt to pay;\nFor by Your cross, absolved I am\nFrom sin and guilt, from fear and shame.","Lord, I believe Your precious blood,\nWhich at the mercy seat of God\nPleads for the captives' liberty,\nWas also shed in love for me.","When from the dust of death I rise\nTo claim my mansion in the skies,\nThis then shall be my only plea:\nChrist Jesus lived and died for me."],"chorus":""}
