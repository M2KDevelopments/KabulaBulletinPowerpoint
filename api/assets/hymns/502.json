{"number":502,"title":"502. Sun of My Soul","verses":["Sun of my soul, O Savior dear!\nIt is not night if Thou be near;\nO may no earth-born cloud arise\nTo hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes.","When soft the dews of kindly sleep\nMy weary eyelids gently steep\nBe my last thought; how sweet to rest\nForever on my Savior's breast!","Abide with me from morn till eve,\nFor without Thee I cannot live;\nAbide with me when night is nigh,\nFor without Thee I dare not die.","Be near and bless me when I wake,\nEre through the world my way I take;\nTill in the ocean of Thy love\nI lose myself in heaven above."],"chorus":""}
