Hark Ten Thousand Harps and Voices","verses":["Hark! ten thousand harps and voices\r\nSound the note of praise above;\r\nJesus reigns, and heaven rejoices,\r\nJesus reigns, the God of love:\r\nSee, He sits on yonder throne;\r\nJesus rules the world alone.\r\nAlleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Amen.","King of glory, reign forever,\r\nThine an everlasting crown;\r\nNothing from Thy love shall sever\r\nThose whom Thou hast made Thine own;\r\nHappy objects of Thy grace,\r\nDestined to behold Thy face.\r\nAlleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Amen.","Savior, hasten Thine appearing;\r\nBring, O bring the glorious day,\r\nWhen, the awful summons hearing,\r\nHeaven and earth shall pass away:;\r\nThen, with golden harps we'll sing,\r\n\"Glory, glory to our King!\"\r\nAlleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Amen."],"chorus":""}
