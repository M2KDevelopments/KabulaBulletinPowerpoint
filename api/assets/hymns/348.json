{"number":348,"title":"348. The Church Has One Foundation","verses":["The church has one foundation,\n'Tis Jesus Christ her Lord;\nShe is His new creation,\nBy water and the word;\nFrom heaven He came and sought her\nTo be His holy bride;\nWith His own blood He bought her,\nAnd for her life He died.","Elect from every nation,\nYet one o'er all the earth,\nHer charter of salvation,\nOne Lord, one faith, one birth;\nOne holy name she blesses,\nPartakes one holy food,\nAnd to one hope she presses,\nWith every grace endued.","Though with a scornful wonder,\nMen see her sore oppressed,\nThough foes would rend asunder\nThe Rock where she doth rest,\nYet saints their faith are keeping;\nTheir cry goes up, \"How long?\"\nAnd soon the night of weeping\nShall be the morn of song.","'Mid toil and tribulation,\nAnd tumult of her war,\nShe waits the consummation\nOf peace forevermore;\nTill with the vision glorious\nHer longing eyes are blest,\nAnd the great church victorious\nShall be the church at rest."],"chorus":""}
