{"number":300,"title":"300. Rock of Ages","verses":["Rock of Ages, cleft for me,\nLet me hide myself in Thee;\nLet the water and the blood,\nFrom Thy riven side which flowed,\nBe of sin the double cure,\nCleanse me from its guilt and power.","Not the labors of my hands\nCan fulfill Thy law's demands;\nCould my zeal no respite know,\nCould my tears forever flow,\nAll for sin could not atone;\nThou must save, and Thou alone.","When my pilgrimage I close,\nVictor o'er the last of foes,\nWhen I soar to worlds unknown,\nAnd behold Thee on Thy throne,\nRock of Ages, cleft for me,\nLet me hide myself in Thee."],"chorus":""}
