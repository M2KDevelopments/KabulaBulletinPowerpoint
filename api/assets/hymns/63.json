O Come, Let Us Sing to the Lord","verses":["O come, let us sing to the Lord,\nCome let us every one\nA joyful noise make to the Rock\nOf our salvation.","Let us before His presence come\nWith glad and thankful voice;\nLet us sing psalms of praise to Him,\nAnd make a joyful noise.","For God, a great God and great King,\nAbove all gods, He is;\nThe depths of earth are in His hand,\nThe strength of hills is His.","To Him the ocean vast belongs,\nFor He the sea did make;\nThe dry land also from His hands,\nIts form at first did take.","O come, bow down and worship Him,\nAnd kneeling, humbly pray,\nCome to our Maker and our God,\nAnd hear His voice today."],"chorus":""}
