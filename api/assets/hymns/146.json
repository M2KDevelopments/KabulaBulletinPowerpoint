I Think When I Read That Sweet Story","verses":["I think when I read that sweet story of old,\nWhen Jesus was here among men,\nHow He called little children as lambs to His fold,\nI should like to have been with Him then.","I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,\nThat His arm had been thrown around me,\nAnd that I might have seen His kind look when He said,\n\"Let the little ones come unto Me.\"","I long for the joy of that glorious time,\nThe sweetest and brightest and best,\nWhen the dear little children of every clime\nShall crowd to His arms and be blest."],"chorus":""}
