Go to Dark Gethsemane","verses":["Go to dark Gethsemane,\nYe that feel the tempter's power;\nYour Redeemer's conflict see;\nWatch with Him one bitter hour;\nTurn not from His griefs away;\nLearn of Jesus Christ to pray.","See Him at the judgment hall,\nBeaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;\nSee Him meekly bearing all;\nLove to man His soul sustained;\nShun not suffering, shame, or loss;\nLearn of Christ to bear the cross.","Calvary's mournful mountain climb;\nThere adoring at His feet,\nMark that miracle of time,\nGod's own sacrifice complete;\n\"It is finished!\" hear Him cry;\nLearn of Jesus Christ to die."],"chorus":""}
