For All the Saints","verses":["For all the saints who from their labors rest,\nWho Thee by faith before the world confessed,\nThy name, O Jesus, be forever blest:\nAlleluia! Alleluia!","Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress, and their Might,\nThou, Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight;\nThou, in the darkness drear, their one true light:\nAlleluia! Alleluia!","O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,\nFight as the saints who nobly fought of old,\nAnd win with them the victor's crown of gold:\nAlleluia! Alleluia!","And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,\nSteals on the ear the distant triumph song,\nAnd hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.\nAlleluia! Alleluia!","From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,\nThro' gates of pearl streams in the countless host,\nSinging to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\nAlleluia! Alleluia!"],"chorus":""}
