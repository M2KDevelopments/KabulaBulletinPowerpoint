        "I will extol the Lord at all times;\nhis praise will always be on my lips.\nMy soul will boast in the Lord;\nlet the afflicted hear and rejoice.\nGlorify the Lord with me;\nlet us exalt his name together.",
        "I sought the Lord, and he answered me;\nHe delivered me from all my fears.\nThose who look to him are radiant;\r\ntheir faces are never covered with shame.",
        "This poor man called, and the Lord heard him;\nhe saved him out of all his troubles\r\nThe angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him,\nAnd he delivers them.",
        "Taste and see that the Lord is good;\r\nblessed is the man who takes refuge in him.\nFear the Lord, you his saints,\nfor those who fear him lack nothing.",
        "The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them;\nHe delivers them from all their troubles.\nThe Lord is close to the broken hearted\nAnd saves those who are crushed in spirit.",
        "Evil will slay the wicked;\nThe foes of the righteous will be condemned.\nThe Lord Redeems his servants;\r\nNo one who takes refuge in him will be condemned."
