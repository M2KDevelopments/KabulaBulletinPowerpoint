Lord of the Boundless Curves of Space","verses":["Lord of the boundless curves of space\nAnd time's deep mystery,\nTo Your creative might we trace\nAll nature's energy.","Your mind conceived the galaxy,\nEach atom's secret planned,\nAnd every age of history\nYour purpose, Lord, has spanned.","Yours is the image stamped on man,\nThough marred by man's own sin;\nAnd Yours the liberating plan\nAgain his soul to win.","Give us to know Your truth; but more,\nThe strength to do Your will;\nUntil the love our souls adore\nShall all our being fill."],"chorus":""}
