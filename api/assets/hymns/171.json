{"number":171,"title":"171. Thine Is the Glory","verses":["Thine is the glory,\nRisen, conquering Son;\nEndless is the vict'ry\nThou o'er death hast won.\nAngels in bright raiment\nRolled the stone away,\nKept the folded graveclothes\nWhere Thy body lay.","Lo! Jesus meets us,\nRisen, from the tomb;\nLovingly He greets us,\nScatters fear and gloom;\nLet His church with gladness\nHymns of triumph sing,\nFor her Lord now liveth;\nDeath hath lost its sting.","No more we doubt Thee,\nGlorious Prince of Life!\nLife is naught without Thee;\nAid us in our strife;\nMake us more than conqu'rors,\nThrough Thy deathless love;\nBring us safe through Jordan\nWith Thy power and love."],"chorus":"Thine is the glory,\nRisen, conquering Son;\nEndless is the vict'ry\nThou o'er death hast won."}
