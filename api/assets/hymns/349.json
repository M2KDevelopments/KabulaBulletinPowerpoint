{"number":349,"title":"349. God Is Love","verses":["Here in Christ we gather, love of Christ our calling.\nChrist, our love, is with us, gladness be His greeting.\nLet us fear Him, yes, and love Him, God eternal.\nLoving Him, let each love Christ in all his brethren.","When we Christians gather, members of one body,\nLet there be in us no discord but one spirit.\nBanished now be anger, strife, and every quarrel.\nChrist, our God, be always present here among us.","Grant us love's fulfillment, joy with all the blessed,\nWhen we see Your face, O Savior, in its glory.\nShine on us, O purest Light of all creation,\nBe our bliss while endless ages sing Your praises."],"chorus":"God is love, and where true love is\r\nGod Himself is there."}
