Ride On in Majesty","verses":["Ride on! ride on in majesty!\nHark, all the tribes hosanna cry;\nO Savior meek, pursue Thy road\nWith palms and scattered garments strowed.","Ride on! ride on in majesty!\nIn lowly pomp ride on to die;\nO Christ, Thy triumphs now begin\nO'er captive death and conquered sin.","Ride on! ride on in majesty!\nThe winged squadrons of the sky\nLook down with sad and wondering eyes\nTo see the approaching sacrifice.","Ride on! ride on in majesty!\nIn lowly pomp ride on to die;\nBow Thy meek head to mortal pain,\nThen take, O God, Thy power and reign."],"chorus":""}
