{"number":380,"title":"380. Welcome, Day of Sweet Repose","verses":["Welcome, day of sweet repose!\nBlessed be thy sacred hours!\nWe would trust the One who knows\nAll our weak and failing powers.","Welcome, day in Eden born!\nHoly rest for sinless man!\nLike the dawning of fair morn\nCome thy hours to us again.","Welcome, day blessed by our Lord!\nToil shall cease and anxious care.\nDay commanded by His word,\nDay for song and praise and prayer.","Welcome, day our Savior kept!\nKeeping, wrought our righteousness,\nDay God bids us ne'er forget,\nDay of days His name to bless."],"chorus":""}
