{"number":472,"title":"472. A Song of Heaven and Homeland","verses":["Sometimes I hear strange music,\nLike none e'er heard before,\nCome floating softly earthward\nAs thro' heav'n's open door:\nIt seems like angel voices,\nIn strains of joy and love,\nThat swell the mighty chorus\nAround the throne above.","Now soft, and low, and restful,\nIt floods my soul with peace,\nAs if God's benediction\nBade all earth's troubles cease.\nThen grander than the voices,\nOf wind, and wave, and sea;\nIt fills the dome of heaven\nWith glorious harmony.","This music haunts me ever,\nLike something heard in dreams;\nIt seems to catch the cadence\nOf heav'nly winds and streams.\nMy heart is filled with rapture,\nTo think, some day to come,\nI'll sing it with the angels;\nThe song of heav'n and home."],"chorus":"O sweet, celestial music,\nHeard from a land afar;\nThe song of Heav'n and Homeland,\nThro' doors God leaves ajar!"}
