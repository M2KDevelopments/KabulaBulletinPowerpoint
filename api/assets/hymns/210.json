{"number":210,"title":"210. Wake, Awake, for Night Is Flying","verses":["Wake, awake, for night is flying,\nThe watchmen on the heights are crying,\nAwake, Jerusalem, arise!\nMidnight's solemn hour is tolling,\nHis chariot wheels are nearer rolling,\nHe comes; prepare, ye virgins wise.\nRise up, with willing feet\nGo forth, the Bridegroom meet; Alleluia!\nBear through the night your well-trimmed light,\nSpeed forth to join the marriage rite.","Zion hears the watchmen singing,\nHer heart with deep delight is springing,\nShe wakes, she rises from her gloom;\nForth her Bridegroom comes, all-glorious,\nIn grace arrayed, by truth victorious;\nHer Star is risen, her Light is come!\nAll hail, incarnate Lord,\nOur crown, and our reward! Alleluia!\nWe haste along, in pomp of song,\nAnd gladsome join the marriage throng.","Lamb of God, the heavens adore Thee,\nAnd men and angels sing before Thee,\nWith harp and cymbal's clearest tone.\nBy the pearly gates in wonder\nWe stand, and swell the voice of thunder,\nThat echoes round Thy dazzling throne.\nNo vision ever brought,\nNo ear hath ever caught, Such bliss and joy;\nWe raise the song, we swell the throng,\nTo praise Thee ages all along."],"chorus":""}
