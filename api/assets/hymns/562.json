{"number":562,"title":"562. Come Sing A Song of Harvest","verses":["Come, sing a song of harvest,\nOf thanks for daily food!\nTo offer God the first fruits\nIs old as gratitude.","Long, long ago, the reapers,\nBefore they kept the feast,\nPut firstfruits in a basket,\nAnd took it to the priest.","Shall we, sometimes forgetful\nOf where creation starts,\nWith science in our pockets\nLose wonder from our hearts?","May God, the great creator,\nTo whom all life belongs,\nAccept this gifts we offer,\nOur service and our songs.","And lest the world go hungry\nWhile ourselves are fed,\nMake each of us more ready\nTo share our daily bread."],"chorus":""}
