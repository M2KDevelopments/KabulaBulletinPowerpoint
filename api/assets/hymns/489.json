{"number":489,"title":"489. Jesus, Lover of My Soul","verses":["Jesus, lover of my soul,\nLet me to Thy bosom fly,\nWhile the billows near me roll,\nWhile the tempest still is high;\nHide me, O my Savior, hide!\nTill the storm of life is past;\nSafe into the haven guide,\nO receive my soul at last!","Other refuge have I none,\nHangs my helpless soul on Thee;\nLeave, O leave me not alone!\nStill support and comfort me;\nAll my trust on Thee is stayed,\nAll my help from Thee I bring;\nCover my defenseless head\nWith the shadow of Thy wing.","Thou, O Christ, art all I want,\nMore than all in Thee I find;\nRaise the fallen, cheer the faint,\nHeal the sick, and lead the blind.\nJust and holy is Thy name,\nI am all unrighteousness;\nVile and full of sin I am,\nThou art full of truth and grace.","Plenteous grace with Thee is found;\nGrace to pardon all my sin;\nLet the healing streams abound,\nMake and keep me pure within;\nThou of life the Fountain art,\nFreely let me take of Thee;\nSpring Thou up within my heart,\nRise to all eternity."],"chorus":""}
