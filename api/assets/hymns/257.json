Come Down, O Love Divine","verses":["Come down, O Love divine,\nSeek Thou this soul of mine,\nAnd visit it with Thine own ardor glowing;\nO Comforter, draw near,\nWithin my heart appear,\nAnd kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.","O let it freely burn,\nTill earthly passions turn\nTo dust and ashes in its heat consuming;\nAnd let Thy glorious light\nShine ever on my sight,\nAnd clothe me round, the while my path illuming.","Let holy charity\nMine outward vesture be,\nAnd lowliness become my inner clothing;\nTrue lowliness of heart\nWhich takes the humbler part,\nAnd o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.","And so the yearning strong,\nWith which the soul will long,\nShall far outpass the power of human telling;\nFor none can guess its grace,\nTill he become the place\nWhere in the Holy Spirit makes His dwelling."],"chorus":""}
