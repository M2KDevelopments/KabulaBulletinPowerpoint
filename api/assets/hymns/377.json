Go Forth Go Forth With Christ","verses":["Go forth, go forth with Christ,\nWho called you to this day,\nHe who has led, will lead\r\nAnd keep you in His way:\nHis word is fast, His promise sure\r\nTo all who serve Him and endure.","Go forth, go forth with Christ,\nWith purpose not your own,\nEach vict'ry you shall gain\nThrough Him your Lord alone:\nTo guard you in fidelity\nHis Spirit shall your strength'ner be.","Go forth, go forth with Christ,\nHis Priesthood you shall share,\nWho bought us by His blood\r\nTo be His servants here:\nWalk in the way your Savior trod,\nGo forth with Him, go forth with God."],"chorus":""}
