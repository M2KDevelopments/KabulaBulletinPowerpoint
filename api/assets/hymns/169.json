Come, You Faithful","verses":["Come, you faithful, raise the strain\nOf triumphant gladness;\nGod has brought His people forth\nInto joy from sadness.\nNow rejoice, Jerusalem,\nAnd with true affection\nWelcome in unwearied strains\nJesus' resurrection.","'Tis the spring of souls today;\nChrist has burst His prison;\nFrom the frost and gloom of death\nLight and life have risen.\nAll the winter of our sins,\nLong and dark, is flying\nFrom His light, to whom we give\nThanks and praise undying.","\"Alleluia!\" now we cry\nTo our King immortal,\nWho, triumphant, burst the bars\nOf the tomb's dark portal;\n\"Alleluia!\" with the Son,\nGod the Father praising;\n\"Alleluia!\" yet again\nTo the Spirit raising."],"chorus":""}
