I'm a Pilgrim","verses":["I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger;\nI can tarry, I can tarry but a night;\nDo not detain me, for I am going\nTo where the fountains are ever flowing.","There the glory is ever shining!\nO, my longing heart, my longing heart is there;\nHere in this country so dark and dreary,\nI long have wandered forlorn and weary.","There's the city to which I journey;\nMy Redeemer, my Redeemer is its light!\nThere is no sorrow, nor any sighing,\nNor any tears there, or any dying."],"chorus":"I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger;\nI can tarry, I can tarry but a night."}
