{"number":356,"title":"356. All Who Love and Serve Your City","verses":["All who love and serve your city,\nAll who bear its daily stress,\nAll who cry for peace and justice,\nAll who curse and all who bless.","In your day of loss and sorrow,\nIn your day of helpless strife,\nHonor, peace, and love retreating,\nSeek the Lord, who is your life.","For all days are days of judgment,\nAnd the Lord is waiting still,\nDrawing near His friends who spurn Him,\nOff'ring peace from Calv'ry's hill.","Risen Lord, shall yet the city\r\nBe the city of despair?\r\nCome today, our judge, our glory;\nBe its name \"The Lord is there!\""],"chorus":""}
