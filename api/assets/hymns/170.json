Come, You Faithful","verses":["Come, you faithful, raise the strain\nOf triumphant gladness;\nGod has brought His Israel\nInto joy from sadness;\nLoosed from Pharoah's bitter yoke\nJacob's sons and daughters;\nLed them with unmoistened foot\nThrough the Red Sea waters.","'Tis the spring of souls today;\nChrist has burst His prison,\nAnd from three days' sleep in death\nAs a sun has risen;\nAll the winter of our sins,\nLong and dark, is flying\nFrom His light, to whom is giv'n\nLaud and praise undying.","Now the queen of seasons, bright\nWith the day of splendor,\nWith the royal feast of feasts,\nComes its joy to render;\nComes to gladden faithful hearts\nWhich with true affection\nWelcome in unwearied strain\nJesus' resurrection.","For today among the twelve\nChrist appeared, bestowing\nHis deep peace, which evermore\nPasses human knowing.\nNeither could the gates of death,\nNor the tomb's dark portal,\nNor the watchers, nor the seal,\nHold Him as a mortal.","\"Alleluia!\" now we cry\nTo our King immortal,\nWho, triumphant, burst the bars\nOf the tomb's dark portal;\n\"Alleluia\" with the Son,\nGod the Father praising;\n\"Alleluia!\" yet again\nTo the Spirit raising."],"chorus":""}
