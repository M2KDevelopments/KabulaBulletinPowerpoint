{"number":237,"title":"237. In the Cross of Christ I Glory","verses":["In the cross of Christ I glory,\nTowering o'er the wrecks of time;\nAll the light of sacred story\nGathers round its head sublime.","When the woes of life o'ertake me,\nHopes deceive, and fears annoy,\nNever shall the cross forsake me;\nLo! it glows with peace and joy.","When the sun of bliss is beaming\nLight and love upon my way,\nFrom the cross the radiance streaming\nAdds new luster to the day.","Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,\nBy the cross are sanctified;\nPeace is there that knows no measure,\nJoys that through all time abide."],"chorus":""}
