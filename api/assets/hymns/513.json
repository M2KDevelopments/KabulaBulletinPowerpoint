{"number":513,"title":"513. In Heavenly Love Abiding","verses":["In Heavenly love abiding,\nNo change my heart shall fear,\nAnd safe is such confiding,\nFor nothing changes here.\nThe storm may roar without me,\nMy heart may low be laid;\nBut God is round about me,\nAnd can I be dismayed?","Wherever He may guide me,\nNo want shall turn me back;\nMy Shepherd is beside me,\nAnd nothing can I lack.\nHis wisdom ever waketh,\nHis sight is never dim;\nHe knows the way He taketh,\nAnd I will; walk with Him.","Green pastures are before me,\nWhich yet I have not seen;\nBright skies will soon be o'er me,\nWhere the darkest clouds have been.\nMy hope I cannot measure,\nThe path to life is free;\nMy Saviour has my treasure,\nAnd He will walk with me."],"chorus":""}
