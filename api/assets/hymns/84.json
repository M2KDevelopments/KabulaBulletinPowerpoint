King, who ordainest\nGreat winds Thy clarions, the lightnings Thy sword;\nShow forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,\nGive to us peace, O most merciful Lord.","God the all merciful! earth hath forsaken\nThy precepts holy, and slighted Thy word;\nBid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;\nGive to us peace, O most merciful Lord.","God the all righteous One! man hath defied Thee;\nYet to eternity standeth Thy word;\nFalsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee;\nProsper the right, O most merciful Lord.","So shall we render Thee thankful devotion,\nFor Thy deliverance from peril and sword,\nSinging in chorus from ocean to ocean,\n\"Thine is the power and the glory, O Lord.\""],"chorus":""}
