Lover of my soul;\nFriends may fail me, foes assail me,\nHe, my Savior, makes me whole.","Jesus! what a Strength for weakness!\nLet me hide myself in Him;\nTempted, tried, and sometimes failing,\nHe, my Strength, my vict'ry wins.","Jesus! what a Help in sorrow!\nWhile the billows o'er me roll,\nEven when my heart is breaking,\nHe, my Comfort, helps my soul.","Jesus! I do now receive Him,\nMore than all in Him I find,\nHe hath granted me forgiveness,\nI am His, and He is mine."],"chorus":"Hallelujah! what a Savior!\nHallelujah! what a Friend!\nSaving, helping, keeping, loving,\nHe is with me to the end."}
