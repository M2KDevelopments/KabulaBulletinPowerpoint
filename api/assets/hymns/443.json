There'll Be No Sorrow There","verses":["There'll be no night in heaven,\nIn that blest world above;\nNo anxious toil, no weary hours;\nFor labor there is love.","There'll be no grief in heaven;\nFor life is one glad day,\nAnd tears are those of former things\nWhich all have passed away.","There'll be no sin in heaven;\nBehold that blessed throng,\nAll holy in their spotless robes,\nAll holy in their song.","There'll be no sorrow there,\nThere'll be no sorrow there;\nIn heaven above, where all is love,\nThere'll be no sorrow there."],"chorus":""}
