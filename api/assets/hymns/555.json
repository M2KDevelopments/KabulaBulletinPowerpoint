Shepherd of Tender Youth","verses":["Shepherd of tender youth,\nGuiding in love and truth,\nThrough devious ways;\nChrist our triumphant King,\nWe come Thy name to sing,\nHither our children bring\nTo shout Thy praise.","Thou art our holy Lord,\nThe all-subduing Word,\nHealer of strife;\nThou didst Thyself abase,\nThat from sin's deep disgrace\nThou mightest save our race,\nAnd give us life.","Thou art the great High Priest;\nThou hast prepared the feast\nOf heavenly love;\nWhile in our mortal pain\nNone calls on Thee in vain;\nHelp Thou dost not disdain,\nHelp from above.","Ever be Thou our Guide,\nOur Shepherd and our pride,\nOur staff and song;\nJesus, Thou Christ of God,\nBy Thy perennial word,\nLead us where Thou hast trod,\nMake our faith strong."],"chorus":""}
