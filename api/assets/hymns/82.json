{"number":82,"title":"82. Before Jehovah's Awful Throne","verses":["Before Jehovah's awful throne,\nYe nations bow with sacred joy;\nKnow that the Lord is God alone;\nHe can create, and He destroy.","His sovereign power, without our aid,\nMade us of clay, and formed us men;\nAnd when like wandering sheep we strayed,\nHe brought us to His fold again.","We'll crowd His gates with thankful songs,\nHigh as the heavens our voices raise;\nAnd earth, with her ten thousand tongues,\nShall fill His courts with sounding praise.","Wide as the world is His command,\nVast as Eternity His love;\nFirm as a rock His truth shall stand,\nWhen rolling years shall cease to move."],"chorus":""}
