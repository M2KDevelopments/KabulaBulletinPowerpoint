{"number":342,"title":"342. Is This A Day of New Beginnings","verses":["Is this a day of new beginnings,\nTime to remember and move on,\nTime to believe what love is bringing,\nLaying to rest the pain that's gone?","How can the seasons of a planet\nMindlessly spinning round its sun\nWith just a human name and number\nSay that some new thing has begun?","Yet thro' the life and death of Jesus\nLove's mighty Spirit, now as then,\nCan make for us a world of difference\nAs faith and hope are born again.","Then let us, with the Spirit's daring,\nStep from the past and leave behind\nIts disappointment, guilt, and grieving,\nSeeking new paths, and sure to find.","Christ is alive, and goes before us\r\nTo show and share what love can do.\nThis is a day of new beginnings;\nOur God is making all things new."],"chorus":""}
