{"number":154,"title":"154. When I Survey the Wondrous Cross","verses":["When I survey the wondrous cross\nOn which the Prince of glory died,\nMy richest gain I count but loss,\nAnd pour contempt on all my pride.","Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,\nSave in the death of Christ, my God;\nAll the vain things that charm me most\nI sacrifice them to His blood.","See, from His head, His hands, His feet,\nSorrow and love flow mingled down:\nDid e'er such love and sorrow meet,\nOr thorns compose so rich a crown?","Were the whole realm of nature mine,\nThat were a present far too small;\nLove so amazing, so divine,\nDemands my soul, my life, my all."],"chorus":""}
