{"number":49,"title":"49. Savior, Breathe an Evening Blessing","verses":["Savior, breathe an evening blessing,\nEre repose our spirits seal;\nSin and want we come confessing;\nThou canst save, and Thou canst heal.","Though the night be dark and dreary,\nDarkness cannot hide from Thee;\nThou art He who, never weary,\nWatchest where Thy people be.","Though destruction walk around us,\nThough the arrow past us fly,\nAngel guards from Thee surround us,\nWe are safe if Thou art nigh.","Should swift death this night o'ertake us,\nAnd our couch become our tomb,\nMay the morn of glory wake us,\nClad in light and deathless bloom."],"chorus":""}
