{"number":303,"title":"303. Beneath the Cross of Jesus","verses":["Beneath the cross of Jesus\nI fain would take my stand,\nThe shadow of a mighty rock\nWithin a weary land;\nA home within the wilderness,\nA rest upon the way,\nFrom the burning of the noontide heat,\nAnd the burden of the day.","Upon that cross of Jesus\nMine eye at times can see\nThe very dying form of One\nWho suffered there for me;\nAnd from my smitten heart with tears\nTwo wonders I confess:\nThe wonders of redeeming love\nAnd my unworthiness.","I take, O cross, thy shadow\nFor my abiding place;\nI ask no other sunshine than\nThe sunshine of His face;\nContent to let the world go by,\nTo know no gain nor loss,\nMy sinful self my only shame,\nMy glory all the cross."],"chorus":""}
