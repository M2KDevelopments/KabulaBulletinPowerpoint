{"number":583,"title":"583. You That Know the Lord","verses":["You that know the Lord is gracious,\nYou for whom cornerstone\nStands, of God, elect and precious,\nLaid that you may build thereon,\nSee that on that sure foundation\nYou a living temple raise.\nTowers that may tell forth salvation\nWalls that may re-echo praise.","Living stones by God appointed\nEach to his alotted place,\nKings and priests, by God anointed,\nShall you not declare His grace?\nYou a royal generation\nTell the tidings of your birth,\nTidings of a new creation\nTo an old and weary earth.","Tell the praise of Him who called you\nOut of darkness into light,\nBroke the fetters that enthralled you,\nGave you freedom, peace, and sight:\nTell the tale of sins forgiven\nStrength renewed and hope restored.\nTill the earth, in tune with heaven,\nPraise and magnify the Lord."],"chorus":""}
