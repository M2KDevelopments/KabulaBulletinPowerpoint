{"number":461,"title":"461. Be Still My Soul","verses":["Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side;\nBear patiently the cross of grief or pain;\nLeave to thy God to order and provide;\nIn every change He faithful will remain.\nBe still, my soul: thy best, thy heavenly friend\nThrough thorny ways leads to a joyful end.","Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake\nTo guide the future as He has the past.\nThy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;\nAll now mysterious shall be bright at last.\nBe still, my soul: the waves and winds still know\nHis voice who ruled them while He dwelth below.","Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on\nWhen we shall be forever with the Lord,\nWhen disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,\nSorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.\nBe still, my soul: when change and tears are past,\r\nAll safe and blessed we shall meet at last."],"chorus":""}
