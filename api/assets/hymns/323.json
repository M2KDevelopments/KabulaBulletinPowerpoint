O for a Heart to Praise My God!","verses":["O for a heart to praise my God!\nA heart from sin set free,\nA heart that always feels Thy blood,\nSo freely shed for me.","A heart resigned, submissive, meek,\nMy dear Redeemer's throne,\nWhere only Christ is heard to speak,\nWhere Jesus reigns alone.","A heart in every thought renewed,\nAnd full of love divine,\nPerfect, and right, and pure, and good,\nA copy, Lord, of Thine.","Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;\nCome quickly from above;\nWrite Thy new name upon my heart,\nThy new, best name of Love."],"chorus":""}
