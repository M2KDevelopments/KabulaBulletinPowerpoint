{"number":433,"title":"433. Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand","verses":["Ten thousand times ten thousand,\nIn sparkling raiment bright,\nThe armies of the ransomed saints\nThrong up the steeps of light.\n'Tis finished, all is finished,\nTheir fight with death and sin.\nFling open wide the golden gates,\nAnd let the victors in.","What rush of hallelujahs\nFills all the earth and sky!\nThe ringing of a thousand harps\nProclaims the triumph high.\nO day for which creation\nAnd all its tribes were made!\nO joy, for all its former woes\nA thousand-fold repaid!","O then what raptured greetings\nOn Canaan's happy shore!\nWhat knitting severed friendship where\nDeath partings are no more!\nThen eyes with joy shall sparkle,\nThat brimmed with tears of late;\nOrphans no longer fatherless,\nNor widows desolate.","Bring near Thy great salvation,\nThou Lamb for sinners slain,\nFill up the roll of Thine elect,\nThen take Thy power and reign!\nAppear, Desire of nations,\nThine exiles long for home;\nShow in the heavens Thy promised sign;\nThou Prince and Savior, come!"],"chorus":""}
