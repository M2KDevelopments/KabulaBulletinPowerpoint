Lord Bless Our Homes","verses":["Lord, bless our homes with peace and love and laughter,\nWith understanding and with loyalty.\nMay we together follow Christ the Master\nAnd know the blessing of His sov'reignty.","May every heart receive His loving spirit\nAnd know the truth that makes life truly free;\nThen, in that spirit may we live untied,\nAnd find in God our deep security.","Forgive the hurts our selfishness inflicted\nOn those we love and those who love us best.\nChrist, heal the scars, and draw us all together\nIn Him whose will is peace and joy and rest.","Father, in gratitude for homes and loved ones,\nWe open now our hearts to all mankind.\nGrant us Your spirit-love for one another-\nSo in Your peace may we our concord find."],"chorus":""}
