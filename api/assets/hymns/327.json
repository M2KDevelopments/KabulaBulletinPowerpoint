{"number":327,"title":"327. I'd Rather Have Jesus","verses":["I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold,\nI'd rather be His than have riches untold;\nI'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands,\nI'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand.","I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause,\nI'd rather be faithful to His dear cause;\nI'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame,\nI'd rather be true to His holy name.","He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom,\nHe's sweeter than honey from out the comb;\nHe's all that my hungering spirit needs,\nI'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead."],"chorus":"Than to be the king of a vast domain\nOr be held in sin's dread sway;\nI'd rather have Jesus than anything\nThis world affords today."}
