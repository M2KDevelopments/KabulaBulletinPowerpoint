{"number":434,"title":"434. We Speak of the Realms","verses":["We speak of the realms of the blest,\nThat country so bright and so fair,\nAnd oft are its glories confessed;\nBut what must it be to be there!\nWe speak of its pathway of gold;\nIts walls decked with jewels so rare,\nIts wonders and pleasures untold;\nBut what must it be to be there!","We speak of its freedom from sin,\nFrom sorrow, temptation and care,\nFrom trials without and within;\nBut what must it be to be there!\nWe speak of its service of love,\nOf the robes which the glorified wear,\nOf the church of the Firstborn above;\nBut what must it be to be there!","Our mourning is all at an end,\nWhen, raised by the life-giving word,\nWe see the new city descend,\nAdorned as a bride for her Lord;\nThe city so holy and clean,\nNo sorrow can breathe in the air;\nNo gloom of affliction or sin,\nNo shadow of evil, is there.","Do Thou, midst temptation and woe,\nFor heaven my spirit prepare;\nAnd shortly I also shall know\nAnd feel what it is to be there.\nThen o'er the bright fields we shall roam,\nIn glory celestial and fair,\nWith saints and with angels at home,\nAnd Jesus Himself will be there."],"chorus":""}
