{"number":354,"title":"354. Thy Love O God","verses":["Thy love, O God, has all mankind created,\nAnd led Thy people to this present hour;\nIn Christ we see life's glory consummated;\nThy Spirit manifests His living power.","From out the darkness of our hope's frustration,\nFrom all the broken idols of our pride,\nWe turn to seek Thy truth's illumination,\nAnd find Thy mercy waiting at our side.","In pity look upon Thy children's striving\nFor life and freedom, peace and brotherhood,\nTill at the fullness of Thy truth arriving,\nWe find in Christ the crown of every good.","Inspire Thy church, mid earth's discordant voices,\nTo preach the gospel of her Lord above,\nUntil the day this warring world rejoices\nTo hear the mighty harmonies of love."],"chorus":""}
