{"number":148,"title":"148. O Love How Deep How Broad","verses":["O love, how deep, how broad, how high,\nBeyond all thought and fantasy,\nThat God, the Son of God, should take\nOur mortal form for mortal's sake!","For us baptized, for us He bore\nHis holy fast and hungered sore;\nFor us temptation sharp He knew;\nFor us the tempter over threw.","For us by wickedness betrayed,\nFor us, in crown of thorns arrayed,\nHe bore the shameful cross and death;\nFor us He gave His dying breath.","For us He rose from death again,\nFor us He went on high to reign;\nFor us He sent His Spirit here\nTo guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.","All glory to our Lord and God\r\nFor love so deep, so high, so broad;\nThe Trinity whom we adore\r\nForever and forevermore."],"chorus":""}
