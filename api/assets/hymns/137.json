{"number":137,"title":"137. We Three Kings of Orient Are","verses":["We three kings of Orient are;\nBearing gifts we traverse afar\nField and fountain, moor and mountain,\nFollowing yonder star.","Born a king on Bethlehem's plain;\nGold I bring to crown Him again,\nKing forever, ceasing never\nOver us all to reign.","Frankincense to offer have I;\nIncense owns a Deity nigh;\nPrayer and praising all men raising,\nWorship Him, God on high.","Myrrh is mine: its bitter perfume\nBreathes a life of gathering gloom:\nSorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,\nSealed in the stone-cold tomb.","Glorious now behold Him arise,\nKing and God and Sacrifice;\nAlleluia, alleluia!\nSounds through the earth and skies."],"chorus":"Oh, star of wonder, star of night,\nStar with royal beauty bright,\nWestward leading, still proceeding,\nGuide us to Thy perfect light."}
