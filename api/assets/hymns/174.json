{"number":174,"title":"174. Star of Our Hope","verses":["Star of our hope! He'll soon appear,\nThe last loud trumpet speaks Him near;\nHail Him, all saints, from pole to pole;\nHow welcome to the faithful soul!","From heaven angelic voices sound:\nBehold the Lord of glory crowned,\nArrayed in majesty divine,\nAnd in His highest glories shine.","The grave yields up its precious trust,\nWhich long has slumbered in the dust,\nResplendent forms ascending, fair,\nNow meet the Savior in the air.","Descending with His azure throne,\nHe claims the kingdom for His own;\nThe saints rejoice, they shout, they sing,\nAnd hail Him their triumphant King."],"chorus":""}
