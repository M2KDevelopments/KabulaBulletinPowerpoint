Open My Eyes That I May See","verses":["Open my eyes, that I may see\nGlimpses of truth Thou hast for me;\nPlace in my hands the wonderful key\nThat shall unclasp and set me free.\nSilently now I wait for Thee,\nReady, my God, Thy will to see;\nOpen my eyes, illumine me,\nSpirit divine!","Open my ears, that I may hear\nVoices of truth Thou sendest clear;\nAnd while the wave-notes fall on my ear,\nEverything false will disappear.\nSilently now I wait for Thee,\nReady, my God, Thy will to see;\nOpen my ears, illumine me,\nSpirit divine!","Open my mouth, and let me bear\nGladly the warm truth ev'rywhere;\nOpen my heart, and let me prepare\nLove with Thy children thus to share.\nSilently now I wait for Thee,\nReady, my God, Thy will to see;\nOpen my heart, illumine me,\nSpirit divine!"],"chorus":""}
