{"number":397,"title":"397. An Upper Room","verses":["An upper room did our Lord prepare\nFor those loved until the end:\nAnd His disciples still gather there,\nTo celebrate their risen Friend.","And after supper He washed their feet,\nFor service, too, is sacrament.\nIn Him our joy shall be made complete\nSent out to serve, as He was sent.","A lasting gift Jesus gave His own:\nTo share His bread, His loving cup.\nWhatever burdens may bow us down,\nHe by His cross shall lift us up.","No end there is! we depart in peace.\nHe loves beyond our uttermost:\nIn every room in our Father's house,\nHe will be there, as Lord and host."],"chorus":""}
