Eternal Love We Have No Good","verses":["Eternal Love, we have no good to bring Thee,\nNo single good of all our hands have wrought,\nNo worthy music have we found to sing Thee,\nNo jewelled word, no quick upsoaring thought.","And yet we come; and when our faith would falter\nShow us, O Love, the quiet place of prayer,\nThe golden censer and the golden altar,\nAnd the great angel waiting for us there."],"chorus":""}
