{"number":468,"title":"468. A Child of the King","verses":["My Father is rich in houses and lands;\nHe holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!\nOf rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,\nHis coffers are full; He has riches untold.","My Father's own Son, the Savior of men,\nOnce wandered on earth as the poorest of them;\nBut now He is pleading for sinners on high,\nAnd will give me a home when He comes by and by.","I once was an outcast, a stranger on earth,\nA sinner by choice, and an alien by birth!\nBut I've been adopted, my name's written down,\nAn heir to a mansion, a robe, and a crown.","A tent or a cottage, O why should I care?\nThey're building a palace for me over there!\nThough exiled from home, yet still I may sing:\n\"All glory to God, I'm a child of the King.\""],"chorus":"I'm a child of the King, a child of the King!\nWith Jesus, my Savior, I'm a child of the King!"}
