{"number":630,"title":"630. Rise, My Soul, and Stretch Thy Wings","verses":["Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,\nThy better portion trace;\nRise from transitory things\nToward heaven, thy native place:\nSun, and moon, and stars decay;\nTime shall soon this earth remove;\nRise, my soul, and haste away\nTo seats prepared above.","Rivers to the ocean run,\nNor stay in all their course;\nFire ascending seeks the sun;\nBoth speed them to their source;\nSo a soul that's born of God,\nLongs to view His glorious face,\nForward tends to His abode\nTo rest in His embrace.","Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn;\nPress onward to the prize;\nSoon our Savior will return,\nTriumphant in the skies;\nYet a season, and you know\nHappy entrance will be given,\nAll our sorrows left below,\nAnd earth exchanged for heaven."],"chorus":""}
