{"number":219,"title":"219. When Jesus Comes in Glory","verses":["When Jesus comes in glory,\nAs Lord and King of kings,\nO what a wondrous story\nThe blessed Bible brings:\nHis face will shine like sunlight,\nHis head be white as snow,\nHis eyes like flaming firelight,\nHis feet like brass aglow.","His voice like rushing waters\nWill reach with mighty sound\nInto the deepest quarters\nOf all creation round;\nAnd at this wondrous greeting\nThe dead in Christ shall rise,\nTheir Lord and Savior meeting\nIn glory in the skies.","And we who are believing\nAnd His appearing love,\nShall know we are receiving\nHis glory from above;\nHis resurrection power\nWill raise us to the place\nWhere we that wondrous hour\nShall see Him face to face.","O hasten Thine appearing,\nThou bright and Morning Star!\nLord, may we soon be hearing\nThe trumpet sound afar;\nThy people all are yearning\nTo be Thy raptured bride,\nAnd at Thine own returning\nBe caught up to Thy side."],"chorus":""}
