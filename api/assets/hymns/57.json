{"number":57,"title":"57. Now All the Woods Are Sleeping","verses":["Now all the woods are sleeping,\nAnd night and stillness creeping\nO'er city, man, and beast;\nBut thou, my heart, awake thee,\nTo pray'r awhile betake thee,\nAnd praise thy Maker ere thou rest.","My Jesus, stay Thou by me,\nAnd let no foe come nigh me,\nSafe sheltered by Thy wing;\nBut would the foe alarm me,\nO let him never harm me,\nBut still Thine angels round me sing!","My loved ones, rest securely,\nFrom every peril surely\nOur God will guard your heads;\nAnd happy slumbers send you,\nAnd bid His hosts attend you,\nAnd golden-armed watch o'er your beds."],"chorus":""}
