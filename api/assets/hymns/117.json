The Advent of Our God","verses":["The advent of our God\nWith eager prayers we greet,\nAnd singing haste upon His road\nHis coming reign to meet.","The everlasting Son\nWas born to make us free;\nAnd He a servant's form put on\nTo gain our liberty.","As Judge, on clouds of light,\nHe soon will come again,\nHis scattered people to unite\nWith them in heaven to reign.","Praise to the incarnate Son\nWho comes to set us free,\nWith Father, Spirit, ever one;\nTo all eternity."],"chorus":""}
