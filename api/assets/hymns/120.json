{"number":120,"title":"120. There's a Song in the Air","verses":["There's a song in the air! There's a star in the sky!\nThere's a mother's deep prayer And a baby's low cry!\nAnd the star rains its fire while the beautiful sing,\nFor the manger of Bethlehem cradles a King!","There's a tumult of joy O'er the wonderful birth,\nFor the virgin's sweet boy Is the Lord of the earth.\nAye! the star rains its fire while the beautiful sing,\nFor the manger of Bethlehem cradles a King!","In the light of that star Lie the ages impearled;\nAnd that song from afar Has swept over the world.\nEvery hearth is aflame, and the beautiful sing\nIn the homes of the nations that Jesus is King!","We rejoice in the light, And we echo the song\nThat comes down through the night From the heavenly throng.\nAye! we shout to the lovely evangel they bring,\nAnd we greet in his cradle our Savior and King!"],"chorus":""}
