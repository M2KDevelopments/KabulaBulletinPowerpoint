{"number":87,"title":"87. God Who Spoke in the Beginning","verses":["God who spoke in the beginning,\nForming rock and shaping spar,\nSet all life and growth in motion,\nEarthly world and distant star;\nHe who calls the earth to order\nIs the ground of what we are.","God who spoke thro' men and nations,\nThro' events long past and gone,\nShowing still today His purpose,\nSpeaks supremely through His Son;\nHe who calls the earth to order\r\nGives His word and it is done.","God whose speech becomes incarnate-\nChrist is servant, Christ is Lord-\nCalls us to a life of service,\nHeart and will to action stirred;\nHe who uses man's obedience\nHas the first and final word."],"chorus":""}
