{"number":508,"title":"508. Anywhere With Jesus","verses":["Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,\nAnywhere He leads me in this world below;\nAnywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade;\nAnywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.","Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;\nOther friends may fail me, He is still my own;\nThough His hand may lead me over dreary ways,\nAnywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.","Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,\nWhen the gloomy shadows round about me creep,\nKnowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;\nAnywhere with Jesus will be home sweet home."],"chorus":"Anywhere! anywhere!\nFear I cannot know;\nAnywhere with Jesus\nI can safely go."}
