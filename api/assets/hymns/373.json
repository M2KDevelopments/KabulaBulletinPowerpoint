{"number":373,"title":"373. Seeking the Lost","verses":["Seeking the lost; yes, kindly entreating\nWanderers on the mountain astray;\n\"Come unto Me,\" His message repeating,\nWords of the Master speaking today.","Seeking the lost; and pointing to Jesus\nSouls that are weak and hearts that are sore,\nLeading them forth in ways of salvation,\nShowing the path to life evermore.","Thus I would go on missions of mercy,\nFollowing Christ from day unto day,\nCheering the faint and raising the fallen,\nPointing the lost to Jesus, the Way."],"chorus":"Going afar upon the mountain,\nBringing the wand'rer back again, back again,\nInto the fold of my Redeemer,\nJesus, the Lamb for sinners slain, for sinners slain."}
