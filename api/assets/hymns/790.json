{"title":"790. The Children of God - 1 John 3  ","number":790,"verses":["See what love the Father has given us,\nthat we should be called children of God;\nand so we are. The reason why the world does not\nknow us is that it did not know him.","Beloved, we are God's children now;\nit does not yet appear what\twe shall be,\nbut we know that when he appears we shall be like him,\nfor we shall see him as he is.\nAnd every one who thus hopes in him\npurifies himself as he is pure.","Every one who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness;\nsin is lawlessness.\nYou know that he appeared to take away sins,\nand in him there is no sin.","No one who abides in him sins;\nno one who sins has either seen him or known him.\nLittle children, let no one deceive you.\nHe who does right is righteous, as he is righteous.","He who commits sin is of the devil;\nfor the devil has sinned from the beginning.\nThe reason the Son of God appeared was to\ndestroy the works of the devil.","No one born of God commits sin;\nfor God's nature abides in him,\nand he cannot sin because he is born of God.","By this it may be seen who are the children of God,\nand who are the children of the devil:\nwhoever does not do right is not of God,\nnor he who does not love his brother.","For this is the message which you\nhave heard from the beginning,\nthat we should love one another."]}
