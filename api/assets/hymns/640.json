{"number":640,"title":"640. For Beauty of Meadows","verses":["For beauty of meadows, for grandeur of trees,\nFor flowers of woodlands, for creatures of seas,\nFor all You created and gave us to share,\nWe praise You, Creator, extolling Your care.","As stewards of beauty received at Your hand,\nAs creatures who hear Your most urgent command,\nWe turn from our wasteful destruction of life,\nConfessing our failures, confessing our strife.","Teach us once again to be gardeners in peace;\nAll nature around us is ours but on lease;\nYour name we would hallow in all that we do,\nFulfilling our calling, creating with You."],"chorus":""}
