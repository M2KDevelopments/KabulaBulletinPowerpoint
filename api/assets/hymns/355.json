{"number":355,"title":"355. Where Cross the Crowded Ways of Life","verses":["Where cross the crowded ways of life,\nWhere sound the cries of race and clan,\nAbove the noise of selfish strife,\nWe hear Your voice, O Son of Man.","From tender childhood's helplessness,\nFrom human grief and burdened toil,\nFrom famished souls, from sorrow's stress,\nYour heart has never known recoil.","The cup of water giv'n for You\nStill holds the freshness of Your grace;\nYet long these multitudes to view\nThe strong compassion in Your face.","O Master, from the mountainside\nMake haste to heal these hearts of pain;\nAmong these restless throngs abide;\nO tread the city's streets again;","Till all the world shall learn Your love,\nAnd follow where Your feet have trod;\nTill glorious from Your heav'n above,\nShall come the city of our God."],"chorus":""}
