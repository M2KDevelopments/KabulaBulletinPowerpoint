Jerusalem My Happy Home","verses":["Jerusalem, my happy home,\nO how I long for thee!\nWhen will my sorrows have an end,\nThe joys when shall I see?","The walls are all of precious stone,\nMost glorious to behold;\nThy gates are richly set with pearl,\nThy streets are paved with gold.","Thy garden and thy pleasant walks\nMy study long have been;\nSuch dazzling views by human sight\nHave never yet been seen.","Lord, help us by Thy mighty grace,\nTo keep in view the prize,\nTill Thou dost come to take us home\nTo that blessed paradise."],"chorus":""}
