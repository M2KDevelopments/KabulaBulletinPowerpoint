{"number":527,"title":"527. From Every Stormy Wind","verses":["From every stormy wind that blows,\nFrom every swelling tide of woes,\nThere is a calm, a sure retreat;\n'Tis found beneath the mercy seat.","There is a place where Jesus sheds\nThe oil of gladness on our heads,\nA place than all besides more sweet;\nIt is the blood-bought mercy seat.","There is a scene where spirits blend,\nWhere friend holds fellowship with friend;\nThough sundered far, by faith they meet\nAround one common mercy seat.","There, there, on angel's wings we soar,\nAnd earthly cares molest no more,\nAnd heaven comes down our souls to greet,\nAnd glory crowns the mercy seat.","Ah! whither should we flee for aid,\nWhen tempted, desolate, dismayed?\nOr how the hosts of sin defeat,\nHad suffering saints no mercy seat?"],"chorus":""}
