{"number":301,"title":"301. Nearer, Still Nearer","verses":["Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,\nDraw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art;\nFold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,\nShelter me safe in that haven of rest,\nShelter me safe in that haven of rest.","Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,\nNought as an offering to Jesus my King\nOnly my sinful now contrite heart;\nGrant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,\nGrant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.","Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine;\nSin, with its follies, I gladly resign,\nAll of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;\nGive me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,\nGive me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.","Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last;\nTill safe in glory my anchor is cast;\nThrough endless ages, ever to be,\nNearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,\nNearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee."],"chorus":""}
