{"number":516,"title":"516. All the Way","verses":["All the way my Savior leads me;\nWhat have I to ask beside?\nCan I doubt His tender mercy,\nWho through life has been my guide?\nHeavenly peace, divinest comfort,\nHere by faith in Him to dwell;\nFor I know whate'er befall me,\nJesus doeth all things well;\nFor I know whate'er befall me,\nJesus doeth all things well.","All the way my Savior leads me;\nCheers each winding path I tread;\nGives me grace for every trial,\nFeeds me with the living bread;\nThough my weary steps may falter,\nAnd my soul a-thirst may be,\nGushing from the Rock before me,\nLo, a spring of joy I see;\nGushing from the Rock before me,\nLo, a spring of joy I see.","All the way my Savior leads me;\nO the fullness of His love!\nPerfect rest to me is promised\nIn my Father's house above,\nWhen I wake to life immortal,\nWing my flight to realms of day,\nThis my song through endless ages,\nJesus led me all the way;\nThis my song through endless ages,\nJesus led me all the way."],"chorus":""}
