I Will Follow Thee","verses":["I will follow Thee, my Savior,\nWheresoe'er my lot may be.\nWhere Thou goest I will follow;\nYes, my Lord, I'll follow Thee.","Though the road be rough and thorny,\nTrackless as the foaming sea,\nThou hast trod this way before me,\nAnd I'll gladly follow Thee.","Though I meet with tribulations,\nSorely tempted though I be;\nI remember Thou wast tempted,\nAnd rejoice to follow Thee.","Though Thou leadest me through affliction,\nPoor, forsaken though I be;\nThou wast destitute, afflicted,\nAnd I only follow Thee.","Though to Jordan's rolling billows,\nCold and deep, Thou leadest me,\nThou hast crossed the waves before me,\nAnd I still will follow Thee."],"chorus":"I will follow Thee, my Savior,\nThou didst shed Thy blood for me;\nAnd though all men should forsake Thee,\nBy Thy grace I'll follow Thee."}
