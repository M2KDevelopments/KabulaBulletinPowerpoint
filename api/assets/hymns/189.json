{"number":189,"title":"189. All That Thrills My Soul","verses":["Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,\nBy His presence all divine?\nTrue and tender, pure and precious,\nOh, how blest to call Him mine!","Love of Christ so freely given,\nGrace of God beyond degree,\nMercy higher than the heaven,\nDeeper than the deepest sea.","Every need His hand supplying,\nEvery good in Him I see;\nOn His strength divine relying,\nHe is All in All to me.","By the crystal flowing river\nWith the ransomed I will sing,\nAnd forever and forever\nPraise and glorify the King"],"chorus":"All that thrills my soul is Jesus;\nHe is more than life to me; (to me;)\nAnd the fairest of ten thousand,\nIn my blessed Lord I see."}
