How Lovely Is Thy Dwelling Place","verses":["How lovely is Thy dwelling place,\nO Lord of hosts to me!\nThe tabernacles of Thy grace\nHow pleasant, Lord, they be!","My thirsty soul longs ardently,\nYea, faints Thy courts to see;\nMy very heart and flesh cry out,\nO living God, for Thee.","Behold the sparrow findeth out\nA house wherein to rest;\nThe swallow also, for herself\nProvided hath a nest.","Ev'n Thine own altars, where she safe\nHer young ones forth may bring,\nO Thou, almighty Lord of hosts,\nWho art my God and King.","Blest are they in Thy house that dwell,\nThey ever give Thee praise.\nBlest is the man whose strength Thou art,\nIn whose heart are Thy ways."],"chorus":""}
