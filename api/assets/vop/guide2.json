      "text": "The Bible is actually a library of 66 books. The 39 books of the Old Testament |\nR were composed from about 1450 B.C. to about 400 B.C., the 27 books of the New ‘ |\n| Testament between A.D. 50 and A.D. 100. ; .\n. The prophet Moses began the first five books of the Bible sometime before 1400 f |\nB.C. The apostle John penned the last book of the Bible, Revelation, about A.D. 95. o\n| | During the 1,500 years between the writing of the first and last books of the Bible, at |\no least 38 other inspired writers made their contributions. Some were businessmen, |\no others shepherds, fishermen, soldiers, physicians, preachers, kings—human beings - . N\nfrom all walks of life. They often lived within contrasting cultures and philosophies.\n| | But here is the wonder of it all: When the 66 books of the Bible with their 1,189 , |\n’ chapters made up of 31,173 verses are brought together, we find perfect unity and | -\n| | 9harmony in the message they convey. ; ~\n| Suppose a man should knock at your door and, when invited in, place an oddly 'z -\nshaped piece of marble on your living room floor, then leave without a word.

What would you have to conclude? That someone had planned the statue and |\n| had sent to each man accurate specifications for his particular piece of marble. | S\n The Bible as a whole communicates one coherent message—just like a perfect | .\nmarble statue.

      "text": "(1) The preservation of the Bible is remarkable. All of the early manuscripts of the Bible were copied by hand I long before there were printing presses. Scribes made copies of the original manuscripts and distributed them. Thousands of copies of such ,\nmanuscripts or portions of them still survive. |\nHebrew manuscripts of the Old Testament that go back 150 to 200 years before |\nChrist were found near the Dead Sea in 1947. It’s amazing that these two-thousand- |\nyear-old scrolls contain exactly the same truths as we find in the Old Testament of\n| _Bibles printed today. This is powerful evidence of how reliable God’s Word is. |\n’ The apostles first wrote much of the New Testament as letters they sent to\n| Christian churches established after the death and resurrection of Christ. More than o\n4,500 manuscripts of all or a part of the New Testament are on display in the great\n| museums and libraries of Europe and America. Some of them date back to the second |\n| century. By comparing these early manuscripts with today’s Bible, we can readily see - |\no | that the New Testament has also remained essentially unchanged since it was first\n| written. | |\nToday the Bible or portions of it have been translated into over 2,060 languages - .\n. and dialects. It is the world’s best-seller: over 150 million Bibles and Bible portions are\n| sold each year. | |\n(2) The historical accuracy of the Bible is remarkable. Many archaeological\ndiscoveries have dramatically confirmed the accuracy of the Bible. Historians have |\n- discovered clay tablets and stone monuments which have brought to light names, o\n\n\n; . _ i ————— i, : '\nplaces, and events previously known only from the Bible. | | )\n- For example, according to Genesis 11:31, Abraham and his family “set out\n| | from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to [the land of] Canaan.” Because only the - | -\n| Bible spoke of Ur, certain scholars stated that no such city had ever existed. | o\ne Then archaeologists uncovered a temple tower in southern Iraq with a TR\n| cylinder at the base written in cuneiform that contained the name Ur. Later | | |\n| finds revealed Ur as the thriving metropolis of a highly developed civilization. |\n| That city’s identity had been forgotten, only the Bible preserved its name— . | S\n| until the spade of the archaeologist confirmed its authenticity. And Ur is only N -\none of many examples of archaeology confirming the accuracy of the Biblt. |\n(3) The accurate fulfillment of Bible predictions shows that you can trust : | |\n| the Bible. Scripture contains many remarkable predictions of future events e -'\n| now being fulfilled before our eyes. We examine some of these exciting | o\n| : prophecies in future lessons."

If you approach Scripture with ; .\n| a heart and mind opened through prayer, it becomes a personal contact with\nJesus (John 16:13-14). - |\n(2) Read the Bible daily. Daily Bible study is a key to power in our lives, | ’\ne | an encounter with the mind of God (Romans 1:16). | | -\nS | | (3) As you read it, let the Bible speak for itself. Ask: what did the Bible | |\n. writer intend to say? By grasping what a text means we can apply it o »\n~intelligently to our life today. ; |\n) (4) Study the Bible by subject. Compare scripture with scripture. Jesus used -\ni this method to prove that He was the Messiah: | |\n“And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them\nwhat was said in ALL the Scriptures concerning himself.” —Luke 24:27. |\nBy putting together all that the Bible has to say on a certain subject we |\ngain a balanced perspective. 4\n| (5) Study the Bible to receive power to live for Christ. The Word of God is |\n¢ described in Hebrews 4:12 as a sharp, double-edged sword. It's more than | ‘, |\n, | ~ words on a page, it’s a living weapon in our hands to fight off temptations to '\nsin.\n(6) Listen as God speaks to you through His Word. If a person is to know\n| the Bible truth about a certain subject, he or she must be willing to follow | -\n| - what it teaches (John 7:17), not what some person thinks, or what some o\nA church teaching asserts."

It deals with the experiences of | | |\nhumanity—birth, love, marriage, parenthood, and death. It heals the deepest |\nwound in human nature, sin and the misery resulting from it. \\ |\n,, God’s Word is not a book of one race, one age, one nation, or one culture. |\nAlthough written in the East, it also appeals to men and women in the West. |\n| | | - It enters the homes of the humble and the mansions of the wealthy.
