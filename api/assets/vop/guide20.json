And that’s what the church is all about. It'sa ‘\n: place where we come to fellowship and help each other. Scripture reveals a dynamic\napostolic church which called men and women into a joyful fellowship that extended all\n| the way up to the Almighty:\n“We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have\nFELLOWSHIP WITH US. And OUR FELLOWSHIP IS WITH THE FATHER AND\n| WITH HIS SON, Jesus Christ. We write this to make our JOY COMPLETE.”\n—1 John 1:3, 4. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are\nfrom the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)\nA community of hearts bonded through contact with Jesus and with one another,\nexperience “joy” to the fullest! They're all speaking the same language, the language of\nlove.\nChristians become part of an extended family. They become brothers and sisters in\nChrist since all have a kindred spirit. The broader the unity of belief, the stronger the\nties among Christians. ¥\nThe members of the churches established by Jesus’ apostles were bound together by\ntheir similar beliefs, their love of God, and their desire to serve Him and share His grace\n‘ to the world. This close bond of fellowship was one of the reasons this powerless and\npersecuted minority turned the world upside down. |"

It has had extremely |\npowerful enemies—from Roman emperors to communist dictators—but the blood of |\nmartyrs has only caused it to grow stronger. When one Christian was burned at the stake e\nor tossed to the lions, several others sprang up to take his or her place. Skeptics have done\ntheir best to reason the Christian Church away. But Christian truth competes more |\n‘ eloquently than ever in a scientific, secular age. ’\nOne of the church’s greatest challenges came soon after its acceptance as tha official ‘\nreligion of the Roman Empire. The church grew prosperous—and eventually was\ncorrupted. It seemed spiritually dead in the Dark Ages. But the Lord always preserved a |\ncore of courageous and faithful believers who, in the bleak and difficult times, shone bright | -\nas stars on a moonless night. |\nPaul compares Christ’s relationship to His church to a husband’s tender, protective | |\nrelationship to His wife ‘ |\n(Ephesians 5:23-25). The church is a family, with each member establishing relationships\nto the other members of the family and contributing to their well-being (Ephesians 2:19).\nPaul also represents the church as a living body, with Christ Himself as its head i\n| (Colossians 1:18).\nWhen we are baptized, we testify to our faith in Jesus and become members of the | : ‘\n“body;’ the church.\n: “For we were all BAPTIZED by one Spirit INTO ONE BODY.” —1 Corinthians\n12:13.\n' The book of Revelation pictures the risen Christ walking among the churches, showing\nHis care over them (Revelation 1:20, 12, 13).

            "title": "A CHURCH WITH A PURPOSE\nChurch attendance is vital for a Christian. We need the support of others to keep our\nfaith alive and growing. |\nThe church also plays three other important roles:\n(",
            "number": 3,
            "text": "1) The church guards the truth.\nAs the “pillar and foundation of the truth” (1 Timothy 3:15), the church upholds and\ndefends God’s truth before the world. We need the collective wisdom of other believers to |\nhelp us focus on the essential truths of Scripture.\n(2) The church is an example of what God’s grace can do for sinners. The changes that |\n. Christ has made in the lives of believers give acclaim to the God who calls us “into his\nwonderful light” (1 Peter 2:9). .\n(3) God’s people are His witnesses to a needy world. Just before He returned to\nheaven, Jesus promised His disciples:\n| “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my ’\nwitnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”\n—Acts 1:8.\nIt is a great privilege for the church to take the message of God’s tremendous love\nworldwide. .\n| 4, ORGANIZED FOR STRENGTH\nThe church that Christ established had a definite organization. One could be included\n\n\ne ——————— A ——————— R S S T :\nin, or excluded from, its membership (Matthew 18:15-18). God’s church\nappointed leaders and had a world headquarters as well as local meeting places\n(Acts 8:14; 14:23; 15:2; 1 Timothy 3:1-13). When they were baptized, believers -\njoined an organized group. (Acts 2:41 and 47).\nThe church exists for mutual encouragement.\n| “And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and\n' good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of ,\ndoing, but LET US ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER—and all the more as you\nsee the Day [of Christ’s coming] approaching.” —Hebrews 10:24, 25. E\nThis is, in a nutshell, what a healthy church group does. Its members build | ,\neach other up in the faith, they encourage one other. God organized His church to\nstrengthen God’s people and also to serve the world. We can do far more together 1 |\nthan we can as isolated individuals. Take just one example: the Seventh-day | - |\nAdventist Church. We carry on an extensive medical work around the world— :\nfrom inner-city health vans to clinics in remote islands of the South Pacific. Our | |\neducational institutions have brought tens of thousands of youth to a knowledge | A\n' of a better life in Christ—from Loma Linda University, pioneering in heart -\ntransplants, to tiny mission schools scattered through the African interior. We ' | : ,\ncarry on famine and disaster relief through ADRA. Local churches help clothe\n\" and feed the poor and homeless at thousands of Community Service Centers. -\nAnd groups of Adventist believers are sharing the message of salvation in more o\nthan 200 countries. Only an organized group of dedicated Christians could have -\nthis worldwide impact. |\nChrist and the apostles compared the church to a body, and pointed out that\nall parts of the body are needed (1 Corinthians 12:21-28). All body parts are not a |\nexactly alike, yet all are important and all must work together in harmony. An eye\nseparated from the body can’t see. A hand cut off has no value. Whether we are 3\nan eye, a hand, or only a finger, we can’t be truly effective for Christ totally on our\nown. Belonging to a church, being united to the other members of the body, | |\nstrengthens us as Christians. , |\n| 5 5"
