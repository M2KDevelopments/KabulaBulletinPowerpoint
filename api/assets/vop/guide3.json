  "number": 3,
  "introduction": "Some mornings the world seems a paradise. You wake up, take a deep breath by the window, and look out on golden sunshine reflecting on the trees, leaf by leaf. Some moments make life seem so precious: the face of a beloved friend as you say good-bye, a sublime piece of music that perfectly matches your mood, the unexpected affection of a small child But other mornings, the world seems a place of horror. You wake up to newspaper headlines screaming about yet another terrorist bombing that maimed or blinded a child, yet another serial killer claiming his tenth victim, yet another famine or flood or war or earthquake These are moments when nothing makes sense, nothing seems fair What does it all mean? Can we make sense of our wonderful and terrible world? Why are we here? Does my life really matter to God or am I just a minor cog in some vast cosmic machine?",

      "text": "'In six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.' Exodus 20:11.\n'The eternal, all-powerful Creator could have formed the world in a moment “by the breath of His mouth.” But God chose to take six days to do it—six minutes, or even six seconds would have been sufficient. The first chapter in the Bible, Genesis 1, describes what God created on each day of the creation week. What crowning masterpiece did God create on the sixth day? 'GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE, in the image of God he created him; MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM.' -- Genesis 1:27\nGod decided to create individuals like Himself who could reason and feel and love. Every person is made in God’s “image.' \nBy the sixth day, the world was filled with plants and animals, and then God introduced His masterpiece of creation. According to Genesis 2:7, the Almighty formed Adam’s body from the dust of the ground. So when God breathed “the breath of life” into his nostrils, man became “a living being”—that is, he came to life. God named the first man created in His image, Adam, a word that simply means “man,” and the first woman, Eve, which means a    living” (2:20; 3:20). A loving Creator saw the need for human companionship. \nFresh from the hand of God, Adam and Eve both reflected His image. God could have programmed beings like robots to wander contentedly about the Garden of Eden and raise their voices in adoration to Him. But God wanted more: real relationships. Robots can smile, speak, even do the dishes, but they can’t love. created us in His image, with the capacity to think and choose, and to remember, understand, and love. Adam and Eve were God’s children, and inexpressibly dear to Him",

      "text": "Adam and Eve had everything to make them happy. They enjoyed perfect physical and\n| mental health, living in a beautiful garden home in a flawless world (Genesis 2:8; 1:28-31).\nGod promised them children and the ability to do creative thinking, and to find satisfaction\nin the work of their hands (Genesis 1:28; 2:15). They experienced |\nface-to-face fellowship with their Maker. No trace of worry, fear, or sickness marred their\nblissful days.\n- How did the world change so drastically into a place of suffering and tragedy? The second and third chapters of Genesis tell the entire story of how sin entered our world. Read\nthem at your leisure. Here is a brief summary of their contents. |\nSome time after God established a perfect world, the Devil came to the Garden of Eden\nto tempt Adam and Eve into disobeying their Creator. God limited the Devil’s sphere of\n| influence to one tree in the garden, the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil” And He\nwarned the first human couple to stay clear of this tree and never to eat its fruit, or they\nwould die. |\n- But one day Eve wandered over by the forbidden tree. The Devil quickly launched into | |\n| his sales pitch. He claimed God had lied to her and that if she ate the tree’s fruit she |\n» wouldn't die, but would become wise like God Himself, khowing good and evil, Tragically\n\n\nEve, and then Adam, who had only known good, allowed the Devil to con them, and they\nsampled the forbidden fruit—thus breaking their bond of trust and obedience with God. .\nGod planned for Adam and Eve to “rule” over our world as the stewards of God’s created\nworks (Genesis 1:26). But because they broke faith with God and chose the Devil as their new | |\nleader, the couple lost their jurisdiction. Today the Devil claims the world as his and tries his\nbest to enslave its people. |\nThere are many times when we find ourselves doing something selfish or even cruel when\nwe really want to do the opposite. Why? Because the invisible enemy, the Devil, works to make , | '.\npeople fail morally. |\nAs you read chapter 3 of Genesis, you will discover that sin caused Adam and Eve to hide ' .\no from God in fear. Sin affected all of creation. Thorns appeared along with the flowers. The soil B\nsuffered from drought, and labor became a burden. Disease began to strike at random. ] |\n- Jealousy, animosity, and greed multiplied human miseries. Most terrible of all, with sin came death!"
