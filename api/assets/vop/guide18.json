            "text": "1:29). After Adam and Eve sinned, vegetables were added to their diet (Genesis | |\n3:18). After the flood, the Creator added “clean” flesh foods to the diet (Genesis 7:2-3, 9:1-\n6).\nThe flesh of animals contains both saturated fat and cholesterol, which increase the | |\n| risk of high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and other | |\ndiseases. Today many physicians advise those who eat meat to consume only lean, well- |\ncooked meat and fish and to do so sparingly.\nBecause people on a vegetarian diet are healthier and live longer, many experts in\nnutrition and health urge us to consider returning to humanity’s original diet of nuts, |\n- grains, and fruits with vegetables added. |\n,, |\nm@w%wﬁw&&wﬁ%g”&*@?%m%@”‘@%@agwm%ﬁf@}%ﬁ%ﬁiﬁ“ﬁ\n\n\n‘ N S eSS e teaststyecemer e\nIf youd like to start a vegetarian menu, make sure you first understand how |\nto provide a balanced diet without meat. Eat five or six servings a day of a variety\nof fruits, nuts, grains, legumes, and vegetables. Green and yellow vegetables,\nalong with citrus fruits, are especially important. Use whole grain cereal flour,\nand use brown rice instead of white. Your intake of starches and complex |\ncarbohydrates should consist of six or more servings a day. Replace your intake of\nanimal fats (butter, cream, lard, suet, etc.) with vegetable fats. The above diet is 3\nadequate without meat if you use dairy products. |\nThose who choose to eat meat as a part of their diet, should eat only the ,\nmeats that the Bible indicates are “clean,’ or fit for humans to eat. When God gave ‘\npeople permission to eat meat after the flood (Genesis 7:2-3, Leviticus 11:47), He\ndefined which of the flesh foods were clean, and which were unclean and not fit to |\neat. | |\n| Read in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 the list of birds, beasts, and fish |\nGod pronounced unfit for food. According to these chapters, clean animals must |\ndivide, or split, the hoof and also chew the cud. Clean fish must have both scales | |\nA and fins. Scavenger birds are forbidden.\nAmong the unclean animals, swine are especially mentioned and condemned ' :\n(Deuteronomy 14:8). A high percentage of human bodies autopsied are infected e\n: with trichinae. These tiny worms are transmitted to people who eat infected\npork. Current scientific research increasingly reveals why God declared some\nflesh unclean. One reason may be the danger of disease, such as the trichina | |\nworm in pork. Another reason may be the devastating effects of saturated fat on\nthe human digestive system."

            "text": "103:2-4.\nDavid Larson, a consultant to the National Institute of Mental Health in the\nUnited States, did extensive research on the relationship between religion and\nhealth. His study demonstrated a direct connection between a Christian\ncommitment and health. He was surprised to learn: Those who attend church\nlive longer than those who don’t. Church-goers have a reduced incidence of hgart\nattack, hardening of the arteries, high blood pressure, and other diseases. Those\nwho have faith in God live more productive lives because they are less likely to be\ndepressed, to become alcoholics, to be jailed as repeat offenders, or to be trapped -\nin an unhappy marriage. Trust in divine power is the keystone to genuine well-\nbeing and a healthy and happy life.\n| Approximately 50,000 Seventh-day Adventists were studied, primarily in |\nCalifornia, over 30 years. Results showed that Adventist men live 8.9 years longer\nand women 7.5 years longer than the general population. Studies of Adventists\nin Holland, Norway, and Poland show similar results. Researchers attribute the\nlonger life span of Adventists to their following some or all of the eight health\nprinciples outlined in this guide. Those who follow these principles not only ' ;\nhave a longer life, but also a much better quality of life. ‘\n, Applying the Bible’s perspective to our lives does make a difference in all\nkinds of practical ways, offering convincing evidence that Christianity is the\nmost practical, reasonable religion in all the world. It changes people—their |\nthinking and their actions—and creates a new lifestyle. —\nBecause of the close relationship between the mind, the body, and our\nspiritual life, Christians who live by the Word of God will want to follow the\nprinciples of a healthful lifestyle as they prepare for Jesus’ second coming (1 John\n3:1-3). Christ not only wants us to be ready to meet Him when He returns, He |\n| also wants to improve the quality of our present lives. We can cooperate with\nHim by following God’s basic health principles.\nJesus promises to deliver us from every destructive habit through His “power\nat work within us” (Ephesians 3:20). If you are attempting to overcome some\nbody-destroying habit such as using tobacco or drinking alcoholic beverages,\nyour best resolutions to quit often turn to ropes of sand. But by tapping God’s\npower that is “at work within” you, God can give you strength to overcome. The\nWord of God promises: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”\n(Philippians 4:13).\nwww.biblestudies.com i\nGyt www.bibleinfo.com\no The Voice of Prophecy Bible School, USA\n\n\nRead again the section in Guide 16 identified by the number in the left margin,\nthen place an X before the TRUE statements in each section. | ‘"
