A healthful lifestyle can\nhelp us be vibrant Christians. '\nHere are eight principles to follow if you really want to live a healthier and more\nproductive life:\n1. PURE AIR ' |\nPure, fresh air is essential to good health. During the day and while sleeping gt |\nnight, proper ventilation of our home and workplace insures that our blood will always |\ndistribute enough oxygen to every part of the body. Taking deep breaths during a\nmorning walk is a great way to oxygenate your body. |\nThe kind of air we breathe is obviously important. Be careful not to subject yourself\nto fumes, gases or air-borne bacteria from some hidden source. Smoking pollutes the\nair and is one of today’s big killers. Scientific research has established a causal |\nrelationship between tobacco and lung cancer, emphysema, and heart disease. The\nbody’s addiction to the nicotine in cigarettes makes smoking one of the hardest habits\nto break. Smoking will kill 12 million people a year by the year 2020 if the present trend\n- continues.\n2. SUNLIGHT |\n\" “The benefits of sunlight are many:\n“1. Fifteen to 30 minutes of daily exposure to sunlight in the early morning or late\n| afternoon helps the body synthesize or make its own vitamin D, an essential\nnutrient/hormone in the skin. Vitamin D helps blood to produce calcium and\nphosphorus, which build and repair bone mass.\n“2.Sunlight acts as a disinfectant and a killer of bacteria.\n“3. The sun provides energy by which the plant kingdom can convert carbon dioxide\nand water into carbohydrates. . .. Without this process animals and humans would\nstarve to death. ‘ |\n“4. Sunlight also helps a person adjust to night work and relieves depression related\nto dark days where winter occurs.\n“A word of caution: Sunlight can also be harmful. Prolonged exposure can burn |\nskin, increase the risk of skin cancer, speed up the aging process, damage the eyes, and -\ncause cataracts.” [All quotations in this Guide are from Look Up and Live: A Guide to\nHealth, Adult Lessons, First Quarter 1993, (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press Publishing\nAssociation). Much of the material in this Guide that is not in quotes is condensed from\nthis same publication. |\n3. REST\nThe body must have rest in order to repair itself. We must have time for recreation\nand rest to relieve the tensions of work and family responsibilities. Without their ,\n- required dosage of rest, people often experience anxiety, depression, and irritability.\nSuch emotional stress can lead to illness, which will force us to take the rest our bodies\n| were asking for all along. There’s simply no substitute for a good night's sleep.\nRecharging our spiritual batteries on a daily basis is also important to physical\n: health. A Christian’s daily time of meditation, Bible study, and prayer will heal the body\n3 s s T e *\n","| as well as the soul. We also need a regular break from the work cycle, a weekly day of rest,\nand annual or semi-annual vacations.\n4. EXERCISE v -\n- Exercise is vital to our health:\n“1. Exercise helps to normalize blood pressure.\n“2.Exercise allows more blood to reach all parts of the body, keeping the extremities |\nwarm. |\n“3. Exercise releases both physical and emotional tension, helping you to feel better |\nabout life. Exercise is usually the best cure for worry and stress. | -\n“4. Exercise provides electrical energy to the brain and nerve cells. It promotes health\nby stimulating the immune system. When the body is kept in tone by proper exercisesthe\nmind thinks more creatively and efficiently. |\n“5. 1t can help with your complexion and keep you trim.\n“6. Exercise makes you more energetic, thus delaying both physical and emotional\nfatigue.\n“7.1t aids in the brain’s production of a chemical that gives you a sense of well-being |\n. and increases your tolerance for pain.” |\nIf you have not been exercising, start slowly and increase gradually as you gain\nendurance. It may be wise to consult your physician before starting. Your goal should be\nto engage in any type of exercise that is comparable to walking one mile in 15 minutes four\n; or more times a week.\n5. WATER |\n\" Since water is essential to every cell in the body, we should drink plenty of it.\n“1. By weight the body is about 70 percent\n| water. ... . |\n“2. The body requires about two and one half quarts of water per day to perform all of |\ni its functions. Some of these functions include blood circulation, waste removal, nutrient\ntransport, and digestion. . ..\n“3, The average person has between 15 and 40 billion brain cells. Each one of those is\n70 to 85 percent water. Sufficient water to supply these cells helps keep you mentally alert\nand helps prevent depression and irritability. &\n- “4.1t is not only the water you drink that is important. A cool or tepid daily bath or\nshower improves circulation, thus energizing the body and mind. A shower or bath can\nalso soothe jangled nerves, which can cause illness by weakening the immune system.\nBathing also removes impurities from the skin and can reduce fever”\n6. PROPER DIET\nAt creation God instructed Adam and Eve to eat a diet of nuts, grains, and fruits |\n(Genesis 1:29). After Adam and Eve sinned, vegetables were added to their diet (Genesis | |\n3:18). After the flood, the Creator added “clean” flesh foods to the diet (Genesis 7:2-3, 9:1-\n6).\nThe flesh of animals contains both saturated fat and cholesterol, which increase the | |\n| risk of high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and other | |\ndiseases. Today many physicians advise those who eat meat to consume only lean, well- |\ncooked meat and fish and to do so sparingly.\nBecause people on a vegetarian diet are healthier and live longer, many experts in\nnutrition and health urge us to consider returning to humanity’s original diet of nuts, |\n- grains, and fruits with vegetables added. |\n,, |\nm@w%wﬁw&&wﬁ%g”&*@?%m%@”‘@%@agwm%ﬁf@}%ﬁ%ﬁiﬁ“ﬁ\n","‘ N S eSS e teaststyecemer e\nIf youd like to start a vegetarian menu, make sure you first understand how |\nto provide a balanced diet without meat. Eat five or six servings a day of a variety\nof fruits, nuts, grains, legumes, and vegetables. Green and yellow vegetables,\nalong with citrus fruits, are especially important. Use whole grain cereal flour,\nand use brown rice instead of white. Your intake of starches and complex |\ncarbohydrates should consist of six or more servings a day. Replace your intake of\nanimal fats (butter, cream, lard, suet, etc.) with vegetable fats. The above diet is 3\nadequate without meat if you use dairy products. |\nThose who choose to eat meat as a part of their diet, should eat only the ,\nmeats that the Bible indicates are “clean,’ or fit for humans to eat. When God gave ‘\npeople permission to eat meat after the flood (Genesis 7:2-3, Leviticus 11:47), He\ndefined which of the flesh foods were clean, and which were unclean and not fit to |\neat. | |\n| Read in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 the list of birds, beasts, and fish |\nGod pronounced unfit for food. According to these chapters, clean animals must |\ndivide, or split, the hoof and also chew the cud. Clean fish must have both scales | |\nA and fins. Scavenger birds are forbidden.\nAmong the unclean animals, swine are especially mentioned and condemned ' :\n(Deuteronomy 14:8). A high percentage of human bodies autopsied are infected e\n: with trichinae. These tiny worms are transmitted to people who eat infected\npork. Current scientific research increasingly reveals why God declared some\nflesh unclean. One reason may be the danger of disease, such as the trichina | |\nworm in pork. Another reason may be the devastating effects of saturated fat on\nthe human digestive system.\n7. AVOID THINGS HARMFUL ,\nWhat warnings does the Bible give about alcoholic beverages?\n“Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is\nnot wise.” — Proverbs 20:1.\n“Nor thieves nor the greedy nor DRUNKARDS nor slanderers nor\nswindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.” —I Corinthians 6:10.\nAlcohol affects the following bodily systems:\n“1. The immune system—Alcohol decreases the white cells’ ability to fight ‘ |\ndisease, thus increasing the risk of pneumonia, tuberculosis, hepatitis, and several |\ncancers. |\n“2. The endocrine system—Only two or three alcoholic drinks per day | » |\nincrease the risk of miscarriages, stillbirths, and premature births.\n“3. The circulatory system—The use of alcohol increases the risk of coronary\nheart disease, reduces blood sugar, and elevates blood fats and blood pressure, -\n| thus increasing hypertension. | ,\n“4. The digestive system—Alcohol irritates the stomach, thereby causing\ngastric bleeding. .. . Habitual use of alcohol raises the risk of fatty liver, hepatitis,\nand cirrhosis of the liver”\nAlcohol is responsible for a large percentage of suicides, auto deaths, child |\n_ abuse cases, and home violence. —\n","e —————————————— e\n8. TRUST IN DIVINE POWER\nA person haunted by fear or guilt will find it hard to benefit fully from the\nhealth practices we've just described. But a person enjoying a positive faith in |\nGod will experience the ultimate source of well-being; |\n“Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits—who\nforgives all your sins and HEALS ALL YOUR DISEASES, who REDEEMS\nYOUR LIFE from the pit.” —Psalm 103:2-4.\nDavid Larson, a consultant to the National Institute of Mental Health in the\nUnited States, did extensive research on the relationship between religion and\nhealth. His study demonstrated a direct connection between a Christian\ncommitment and health. He was surprised to learn: Those who attend church\nlive longer than those who don’t. Church-goers have a reduced incidence of hgart\nattack, hardening of the arteries, high blood pressure, and other diseases. Those\nwho have faith in God live more productive lives because they are less likely to be\ndepressed, to become alcoholics, to be jailed as repeat offenders, or to be trapped -\nin an unhappy marriage. Trust in divine power is the keystone to genuine well-\nbeing and a healthy and happy life.\n| Approximately 50,000 Seventh-day Adventists were studied, primarily in |\nCalifornia, over 30 years. Results showed that Adventist men live 8.9 years longer\nand women 7.5 years longer than the general population. Studies of Adventists\nin Holland, Norway, and Poland show similar results. Researchers attribute the\nlonger life span of Adventists to their following some or all of the eight health\nprinciples outlined in this guide. Those who follow these principles not only ' ;\nhave a longer life, but also a much better quality of life. ‘\n, Applying the Bible’s perspective to our lives does make a difference in all\nkinds of practical ways, offering convincing evidence that Christianity is the\nmost practical, reasonable religion in all the world. It changes people—their |\nthinking and their actions—and creates a new lifestyle. —\nBecause of the close relationship between the mind, the body, and our\nspiritual life, Christians who live by the Word of God will want to follow the\nprinciples of a healthful lifestyle as they prepare for Jesus’ second coming (1 John\n3:1-3). Christ not only wants us to be ready to meet Him when He returns, He |\n| also wants to improve the quality of our present lives. We can cooperate with\nHim by following God’s basic health principles.\nJesus promises to deliver us from every destructive habit through His “power\nat work within us” (Ephesians 3:20). If you are attempting to overcome some\nbody-destroying habit such as using tobacco or drinking alcoholic beverages,\nyour best resolutions to quit often turn to ropes of sand. But by tapping God’s\npower that is “at work within” you, God can give you strength to overcome. The\nWord of God promises: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”\n(Philippians 4:13).\nwww.biblestudies.com i\nGyt www.bibleinfo.com\no The Voice of Prophecy Bible School, USA\n","Read again the section in Guide 16 identified by the number in the left margin,\nthen place an X before the TRUE statements in each section. | ‘\n0.
