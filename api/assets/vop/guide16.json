            "title": "A DAILY LINK WITH JESUS =\nCrowds constantly clamored for Jesus’ attention. And yet Christ communicated a peaceful,\ntranquil spirit to everyone around Him. How? He invested time each day communing with |\nHis heavenly Father. He depended on His Father continually for resources to meet life’s\nchallenges (John",

            "text": "6:57). |\n- If we are to live the serene, steady life that He did, we must continually depend on Jesus— ’ .\nlet His Word and Spirit fill us and shape us. The best way to counter the forces burning us out |\nas individuals and tearing us apart as families is to invest quality time with Christ. e tells us: |\n“REMAIN IN ME, and I will remain in you.... APART FROM ME YOU CAN DO\nNOTHING.” —John 15:4, 5. |\nOne of the greatest needs of our time is for people to tap the spiritual resources available\nthrough forming a day-by-day relationship with Jesus. One very important point that needs to\nbe emphasized about our relationship with Christ is His finished work on the cross. True rest, | o\n| real security, can only exist because of the great accomplishment Jesus referred to when He |\ncried out as He was dying: “It is finished” (John 19:30). In other words, His work of redeeming\nus was completed. !\n“But now he [Christ] has appeared ONCE FOR ALL ... TO DO AWAY WITH SIN by the\n: sacrifice of himself.” —Hebrews 9:26. ‘ -\nWhen Jesus died, He did “away with sin.” That’s why it’s said that the believer who has ‘ | :\n! confessed his or her sins can “rest” in the finished work of Christ. Were accepted.\n' Guilt lies behind much of the frantic pace of our lives today. But Jesus solved the guilt\nproblem once and for all at the cross. Jesus’ cry, “It is finished,” sealed His promise of “T will\ngive you rest” as an established fact. Christ completed the work of redeeming us at Calvary |\n(Titus 2:14), then He rested in the tomb over the Sabbath, and rose from the grave Sunday\n- morning as the Victor over sin and death. The Christian can have no greater assurance than to\nrest in the finished work of Christ. ~\n“Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart IN FULL ASSURANCE OF FAITH, ...\nLet us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for HE WHO PROMISED IS FAITHFUL.” '\n—Hebrews 10:22, 23.\nl Because He “who promised is faithful,” we can enter into the salvation-rest Jesus has |\npromised. The stability, peace, and rest we experience in Jesus every day is a result not of\n; anything we do, but of what He did at the cross. |\nWe can rest in Christ because our salvation is assured. That assurance motivates us to J\n! spend time with Christ each day, feeding on His Word and breathing in the atmosphere of *\ni heaven through prayer. A rendezvous with Jesus helps us turn a stressed-out lifestyle into a\n: peaceful and purposeful life. .\n' 3. AWEEKLY LINK WITH JESUS :\nAfter Christ created the world in six days (Colossians 1:16-17), He provided Sabbath-rest. | |\nIt is a weekly opportunity for us to cultivate our connection with Him. |\n- “God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and |\nthere was morning—the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all\ntheir vast array. By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on\n' the seventh day he RESTED from all his work. And God BLESSED the seventh day and\n' MADE IT HOLY, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.”\n' - —Genesis 1:31-2:3. ‘\n\n\nAs their Creator, Jesus “rested” on the first Sabbath with Adam and Eve, and He “blessed” the i\n- Sabbath day and “made it holy” God established a seven-day weekly cycle, not for His own l\n' benefit, but for Adam and Eve and for us today. Because He cared so much for the people He had |\n- made, He planned that every seventh day throughout their lives should be dedicated to seeking\nHis presence. Each Sabbath, as He called it, was to be a day of both physical rest and spiritual\nrefreshment. The entrance of sin into our world only made the need for Sabbath rest more acute. ,\nThe same Savior who promised Adam and Eve “rest,” about two thousand years later gave the ‘\n: law to Moses on Mount Sinai (1 Corinthians 10:1-4). Jesus chose to place the Sabbath-rest\ncommandment at the very heart of the Ten Commandments. The fourth commandment reads:\n- “REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY BY KEEPING IT HOLY. Six days you shall labor and jor'\ndo all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not\ndo any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidServant,\nnor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. For in six days the LORD made the\nheavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he RESTED on the seventh day.\nTherefore the LORD BLESSED the Sabbath day and MADE IT HOLY.” —Exodus 20:8-11.\nGod established the Sabbath as a day to “remember” the Lord who “made the heavens and\nthe earth” Sabbath-rest each week links us with the Creator who blessed this day and set it apart. | o\n| When Jesus lived on earth, He took advantage of every opportunity to sustain His union with\nthe Father. He benefited from Sabbath-rest by worshiping on Sabbath, as Luke tells us: |\n: “He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and ON THE SABBATH DAY he\nwent into the synagogue, AS WAS HIS CUSTOM.” —Luke 4:16.\n| : If the divine-human Jesus needed to rest in His Father’s presence on the Sabbath day, we s\nhuman beings certainly need it more. When Jesus swept aside the legal restrictions the Jews had “\nplaced on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:1-12), He pointed out that God had made it to benefit people:\nP “He said to them, ‘The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son |\nof Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.” —Mark 2:27, 28. ' |\nJesus highlighted the importance of the Sabbath even in His death. He died on Friday, “the i\nPreparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin” (Luke 23:54). At that moment He declared,\n| “It is finished,” that is, His work of coming to this world and dying as substitute for the human\nrace was complete (John 19:30; 4:34; 5:330). Then to celebrate His finished mission, Jesus rested in\n- the tomb over the Sabbath.\nJust as Christ completed His work of creation on the sixth day and then rested on the seventh\nday, so through dying on the cross He completed His work of redemption on the sixth day, and\nthen rested on the seventh. :\nOn Sunday morning Jesus came out from the tomb, a victorious Savior (Luke 24:1-7). He\nhad already asked His disciples to maintain the Sabbath encounter with Him after His\nresurrection. Speaking of the destruction of Jerusalem, which took place nearly forty years after\n| His death, He charged them: |\n“Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.”\n—Matthew 24:20. %\nOur Savior wanted His disciples and their converts to continue the practices He had taught |\nthem (John 15:15, 16). He wanted them to experience both salvation-rest and Sabbath-rest. They |\ndid not disappoint Him. The disciples continued to observe the Sabbath after Christ’s death (see | |\nLuke 23:54-56; Acts 13:14; 16:13; 17:2; 18:1-4). |\n| The beloved apostle John kept up his weekly link with Christ on the Sabbath day. In his later |\nyears he wrote, “On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit” (Revelation 1:10). According to Jesus, “the | |\nLord’s Day” is the Sabbath, “for the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath” (Matthew 12:8).\n~ On the Sabbath we celebrate the Lord’s two greatest accomplishments on our behalf: creating |\nus and saving us. This Sabbath experience will continue in heaven: , |\n‘ “As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,’ declares the\n\n\n| i AR\nBooosnEies o N\nP RENE R BV Y B\n- AJIJ\\VVYLAYN 2 B\nLORD, ... from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down\nbefore me,’ says the LORD.” —Isaiah 66:22, 23. 1"

Its sacred hours offer a wonderful opportunity to get in\ntouch with our roots in God’s created world. When was the last time you or your :\nfamily took time to really soak in the quiet beauty of a forest path or rocky : e\n, stream? The Sabbath gives us time to spend with Jesus and catch glimpses of the |\n. wonders He has made for us. ~\n(2) On Sabbath we experience the joy of worship and fellowship with other | |\nChristians. There’s a benefit from praising God with others as a group of B\n: worshipers. The Sabbath gives us that special time of coming together as a , |\n~ church body to recharge our spiritual batteries. ' k\n(3) The Sabbath provides occasions to perform thoughtful acts of kindness.\n' Has a neighbor been sick during the week when you had no time to visit? When a — |\nfriend needed a sympathetic ear after her husband’s death, did the pressure of\ndaily living deprive her of your loving attention? Jesus advised: “It is lawful to do |\ngood on the Sabbath” (Matthew 12:12). i3\n| (4) The Sabbath is a day to strengthen family ties. When Christ commanded, :\n’ “On [the Sabbath] you shall not do any work” (Exodus 20:10). He couldn’t have |\n| given a better prescription to workaholic dads and stressed-out moms. The e\n- Sabbath is a giant STOP sign for families. Stop letting the most urgent things |\ncrowd out the most important things. The Sabbath is one day when we can |  * |\nreplace pressure with prayer, labor with laughter, busy schedules with quiet < |\nreflection. Sabbath-rest provides the entire family with time to link up with T 1\nChrist and tap into His spiritual energy. e |\n(5) The Sabbath is a time when Jesus comes especially near. Every . |\n~ relationship needs quality time, and our relationship with Christ is no exception. vy |\nDevoting a whole day to Christ each week is a great way to keep our friendship\nwith Him fresh and exciting. The Sabbath gives us extra time for Bible study and\nprayer, extra time to simply be alone with Christ in a quiet place and listen. |\nJesus “blessed the seventh day and made it holy” with the promise of His presence ‘\n(Genesis 2:3). You can understand why it is important to observe Saturday, the seventh :\nday of the week as the Sabbath, because it is the day Christ set apart at creation to @ k |\nw5 communicate with us in a special way. :? | ,\nWhen Jesus created the Sabbath it almost seems that He had our generation in s ‘ '\nmind.
