[ =\nlearn about the Holy Spirit, a Guide who\nN . . .\nwants us to place our lives in His hands.\n.\nAll of us are handicapped by the same\n3 ,\n| . human nature, the same blindness to\n- X = ) - -\n| what’s really most important. Life rushes |\n","by us at such a frantic pace that we often find ourselves just coping instead of going\n\nanywhere. Still, we're hesitant to trust our lives completely to this Guide. But the\n\ndiscovery that awaits each of us is this: we'll find real freedom and power by depending |\non the Holy Spirit to guide us through life. :\n\n1. CHRIST’S REPRESENTATIVE IN THE WORLD |\n\nWhen Christ was about to ascend into heaven, He promised His disciples a priceless\ngift: |\n\n“But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go |\naway, THE COUNSELOR will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.. .. .\nWhen he, THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH, comes, HE WILL GUIDE YOU into all truth. ... |\nHE WILL BRING GLORY TO ME by taking from what is mine and making it known\n\n' to you.” —John 16:7,13,14. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER\nguides are from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].)\n| In the divine plan, Jesus needed to return to heaven as our representative before\nGod’s throne and “appear for us in God’s presence” (Hebrews 9:24). While our crucified\nLord represents us in heaven, we also have the Holy Spirit as our COUNSELOR and |\n| GUIDE right here on earth. He is Jesus’ direct representative. '\n\nWhile here Jesus ministered within the confines of a human body, and couldnt be |\npresent everywhere. But the Holy Spirit has no such limitations; He can serve as a |\npersonal Counselor and Guide to countless individuals in many places at the same time. )\n\n’ Christ meets our needs through the Holy Spirit.\n2. WHO IS THE HOLY SPIRIT?\n‘ Most of us can relate to God the Father if we imagine the most caring, nurturing\nparent we have ever known. And we can picture Jesus the Son, because He lived among\nus as a person. But the Holy Spirit is harder to picture and relate to. We have no easy |\nhuman comparisons. The Bible, however, does give us specific information about the\n| Holy Spirit:\n\nA Personality. Jesus referred to the Holy Spirit as a person, a member of the ,\nGodhead, along with God the Father and God the Son:\n\n‘ “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the\nFATHER and of the SON and of the HOLY SPIRIT.” —Matthew 28:19.\n\nThe Spirit has personal characteristics: a mind (Romans 8:27); wisdom (1 |\nCorinthians 2:10); feelings of love toward us (Romans 15:30); feelings of grief when we\nsin (Ephesians 4:30); the ability to teach us (Nehemiah 9:20); and power to guide us.\n\nInvolvement in Creation. The Holy Spirit participated in the forming of our world\nwith the Father and the Son.\n\n“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. ... And the SPIRIT OF\nGOD moved upon the face of the waters.” —Genesis 1:1, 2, K]JV.\n\n| 3. THE ACTIVITIES OF THE HOLY SPIRIT |\n(1) Changing the human heart. In His encounter with Nicodemus, jesus\nemphasized the role of the Holy Spirit in changing the human heart:\n\no “I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is BORN OF\nwater and THE SPIRIT.” —John 3:5.\n\nTo be “born of the Spirit” means that the Spirit gives us a new beginning. It's more\nthan a matter of modifying our behavior a bit. The Spirit changes us from the inside\nout, fulfilling the promise: “I will give you a new heart” (Ezekiel 36:26). :\n\n| (2) Making us aware of wrongdoing and giving us a desire for holiness:\n","“When he [the Holy Spirit] comes, HE WILL CONVICT the world of guilt in regard\nto SIN and RIGHTEOUSNESS and judgment.” —John 16:8. |\nWhen you hear the dramatic story of someone turning from an immoral lifestyle to\nGod and becoming a faithful spouse and nurturing parent, remember that every step\ntoward wholeness came as a result of the prompting of the Holy Spirit. ' | |\n(3) Guiding us in our Christian life. Christ speaks to us directly through the “still |\nsmall voice” of the Spirit. |\n“Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind _\nyou, saying, ‘This is the way; walk in it.”” —Isaiah 30:21.\nThrough satellite transmission, our TVs regularly bring images and faces from a ;o\ncontinent away into our living room. The Holy Spirit functions a little like God’s satellite, '\n| bringing the presence of Christ from heaven to earth, making Him close when we need N\nHim most (John 14:15-20). ?\n(4) Aiding our prayer life. | |\n“We do not know what we ought to pray for, BUT THE SPIRIT HIMSELF ‘ |\n- INTERCEDES FOR US with groans that words cannot express . .. in accordance with\nGod’s will.” —Romans 8:26, 27. | .\n- When we are struggling to find the words, the Spirit is praying in our behalf. When we | |\nare so discouraged we can only groan toward God, the Spirit amplifies our faint cry for | ’\nhelp into a powerful prayer%efore the very throne of God where Jesus is now ministering. | |\n(5) Developing Christian qualities and character. The Spirit makes spiritually | 5\n' barren individuals as fertile as a tree bearing all kinds of fruit: :\n“BUT THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, ’\n; faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.” —Galatians 5:22-23. |\nHaving the fruit of the Spirit demonstrates that we are grafted into the true vine, Jesus |\n, (John 15:5). Jesus can actually live His abundant life through us by the power of the Spirit. | |\n(6) Preparing us as witnesses. Jesus promises: |\n“YOU WILL RECEIVE POWER when the HOLY SPIRIT comes on you; and you will |\n| be MY WITNESSES ... to the ends of the earth.” —Acts 1:8.\nAll who are willing can be made witnesses by the Spirit. We may not have all the |\nanswers, but the Spirit can give us a story to tell that moves hearts and minds. The |\napostles had trouble communicating before Pentecost, but after the Spirit came they _\nproclaimed Christ with such power that they “turned the world upside down” (Acts 17:6, |\n- KJV). | ’\n4. THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT\nScripture makes a distinction between God’s gift of the Holy Spirit to every believer for\nvictorious Christian living, and the various gifts of the Spirit provided to believers for |\neffective ministry in different ways. |\n“When he [Christ] ascended on high, he led captives in his train and GAVE GIFTS '\nto men. ... It was he who gave SOME to be APOSTLES, some to be PROPHETS, some |\n’ to be EVANGELISTS, and some to be PASTORS and TEACHERS, to prepare God’s |\npeople for works of service.” —Ephesians 4:8, 11-12.\nEach Christian does not receive all the gifts, some may receive more gifts than others; ‘\n| the Spirit “gives them to each one, just as he determines” (1 Corinthians 12:11). The Spirit ‘\nequips each believer for his or her special role in God’s plan. God knows when and where\nto provide the gifts that will best bless His people and His church. |\n- Another list of spiritual gifts found in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 includes wisdom, _\nknowledge, faith, healing, prophecy, speaking in different kinds of tongues [languages,\n: margin|, and the interpretation of languages (verses 8-10).\n",": ' e —————\nT FEEEERL RNy\nPaul urges us to “eagerly desire the greater gifts,” then adds, “and now I will f.\nshow you the most excellent way.” (1 Corinthians 12:31). The love chapter (1 1\nCorinthians 13) that follows this verse emphasizes that “the most excellent way” is i\nthe '\nway of love. And love is the fruit of the Spirit -\n(Galatians 5:22).\nOur concern should be to seek the fruit of the Spirit and then let the Spirit 3\ndistribute His gifts to us as “he determines” (1 Corinthians 12:11). 3\n5. THE FULLNESS OF THE SPIRIT AT PENTECOST\nOn the Day of Pentecost, the Spirit was poured out in unlimited measure, -\nfulfilling Jesus’ promise: ' | et\n“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you | '\nwill be my witnesses . .. to the ends of the earth.” —Acts 1:8. |\nAt Pentecost the Spirit enabled the apostles to communicate the gospel clearly |\nin the languages of people “from every nation under heaven” (Acts 2:3-6). §\n' Some Bible students compare the coming of the Spirit to the falling of the : |\nearly autumn and the late spring rains of Palestine (Joel 2:23). The Spirit falling i : :\nat Pentecost was like the “early rain” of autumn which caused the seeds to sprout :\n; and provided vital nourishment for the Christian church in its infancy. i ‘\n6. THE LATTER RAIN OF THE SPIRIT , |\nBible prophecy tells of a day coming when the Spirit of God will be poured\nout like a shower on the church, energizing the church’s members as witnesses o |\n(Joel 2:28,29). Centuries have now passed and the story of salvation has spread ]\nover a large part of the earth. It's now time for the “latter rain” to ripen the grain,\nmaking it ready to harvest.\nAs history moves to a climax just before Christ’s second coming, God will i |\nprepare every sincere believer for heaven through a great outpouring of His Spirit. | |\nAre you now experiencing the “early rain” that is preparing the church for the |\n“latter rain” of the Spirit? Are you living a Spirit-filled life? As you are empowered |\nby the Spirit, will you let God use you to communicate the news of His incredible |\nlove and soon return? | ! |\n7. CONDITIONS FOR RECEIVING THE HOLY i\nSPIRIT\n| At Pentecost the Holy Spirit moved those who heard the gospel to cry out, - 1\n“Brothers, what shall we do?” (Acts 2:37). _\n“Peter replied, REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED, every one of you, in the\n| - name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. AND YOU WILL :\nRECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT’” — Acts 2:38. 5\nRepentance—turning away from a sinful way of life and turning to Christ— g\nis a condition for receiving the gift of the Spirit. To have the Spirit poured out on .\n; us, we must first repent and commit our lives to Christ. Jesus also emphasized 5 :\n- the willingness to follow Him and obey Him as a condition for receiving the gift Q\nof the Holy Spirit (John 14:15-17). ;\n","| 8. THE SPIRIT-FILLED LIFE\nBefore leaving the world, Jesus instructed His followers:\nL “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the GIFT my Father promised . ..\n| For John BAPTIZED WITH WATER, but in a few days you will be BAPTIZED\n| WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT” —Acts 1:4, 5. '\nOver and over Scripture indicates that the Christian is to be “filled with the\n| Holy Spirit” (Acts 2:4; 4:8, 4:31; 6:3, 6:5; 7:55; 9:17; 13:9, 13:52; 19:6). The Holy\n| Spirit makes the life of a Christian fulfilling and beautiful because a Spirit-filled\n‘ e life achieves Christ’s ideal for us.\nWhile describing the Spirit-filled Christian life, Paul offered this prayer for |\nevery believer:\n| “I pray that out of his glorious riches HE MAY STRENGTHEN YOU «\nWITH POWER THROUGH HIS SPIRIT IN YOUR INNER BEING, so that\nChrist may dwell in your hearts through faith. ... Now to him who is able to |\n‘ do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, ACCORDING TO HIS\nPOWER THAT IS AT WORK WITHIN US.” —Ephesians 3:16, 17, 20,\n= , Like Frank Morris with his faithful guide dog Buddy, we can, with the Holy A\n‘ Spirit guide inside us, do immeasurably more than we could before. With new\n~ desires and new abilities we are enabled to move forward confidently instead of\njust trying to cope with life’s problems. '\nThis Spirit-filled experience is renewed each day through prayer and Bible :\n| study. Prayer keeps us in close contact with Christ, and studying the Word of\n| God keeps us focused on His resources. They break down any barrier between |\nus and Christ that might prevent Him from pouring out His priceless Gift of the\n‘ Spirit. This is how we grow and replace bad habits and attitudes with healthy\nqualities. |\nRomans 8 gives an exciting description of the Spirit-filled life. Read it when\nyou can, and note how many times Paul points to the “Spirit” as the power\nbehind the Christian life.\nHave you made the wonderful discovery of the Spirit-filled life? Are you\nconscious of the presence of the Spirit in your life? Are you experiencing His life-\ngiving power? Open up your life to the greatest power in the universe.\n. _ www.biblestudies.com\ni www.bibleinfo.com\n: The Voice of Prophecy Bible School, USA\n","- DISCOVER — Answer Sheet11\nThe number of each question in your Answer Sheet is the number of the |\nsection in DISCOVER Guide 11 where the answer can be found. | | '\nPlace an X before the one statement that best completes each sentence: B\n1.
