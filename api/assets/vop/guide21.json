History records that\nChristians eventually shifted from worshiping and resting on the seventh day to the '\n, first day of the week. But of course believers didn’t stop observing the seventh-day\nSabbath on a given weekend and then suddenly begin keeping Sunday as the Lord’s |\nDay. The earliest authentic instance of Sunday observance by Christians occurred in |\n' Italy, in the middle of the second century after Christ. For a long time after that many\nChristians observed both days, while still others kept only the Sabbath. e |\nOn March 7,A.D. 321, Constantine the Great issued the first civil Sunday law, |\ncompelling all the people, except farmers, in the Roman Empire to rest on Sunday. & ,\nThis, with five other civil laws decreed by Constantine concerning Sunday, set the !\nlegal precedent for all civil Sunday legislation from that time to the present. In the\nfourth century the Council of Laodicea prohibited Christians from abstaining from | |\n| work on the Sabbath, while urging them to honor Sunday by abstaining from work if ; |\nat all possible. :\nHistory shows that Sunday worship and observance is a man-made custom. The | »\n| Bible gives no authority for doing away with the seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth\ncommandment.

WHAT IS THE REAL ISSUE?\n| This brings us face-to-face with the questions: Why do so many Christians '\n3 observe Sunday without Bible authority? Even more important, Which day shall I |\n| keep? Shall I follow those who say, “I don’t think it makes any difference which day I\nobserve as long as I keep one day in seven™ Or, shall I count as important the day\nJesus, our Creator, established when He created our world, and the day God pointed\n| out in the Ten Commandments: “the seventh day is the Sabbath™? &\nHere we are dealing with more than just an outward observance, but which day\nhappens to be biblically correct. The essential issue is that of obedience to Jesus. Our ' 1\nCreator set aside the Sabbath as a “holy” day, as a time for us and our families to\né come closer to Him for strength and refreshment. Whom shall I obey? Shall I obey\nChrist, the Son of God, or human tradition in the matter of the day I keep holy? The\nchoice is clear: the teachings of men or the commands of God. The word of men or\nthe Word of God. A human substitute or a divine command.\nThe prophet Daniel sounds a warning to those who would “try to change the set _\ntimes and the laws” (Daniel 7:25, NIV) [“intend to to change times and law” (Daniel\n7:25,NKJV)]. God is calling His people back to obedience. He invites them to keep\nthe Sabbath as a symbol of loyalty and love to Him.\nJesus said, “If you love me, you will obey what I command” (John 14:15). And He\npromises fullness of joy to those who love Him enough to obey His commands (John \\\n15:9-11). We have a wonderful Savior. He is eager for us to experience His love in all\nits fullness. A heart of willing obedience opens the door wide to that love.\nIn the Garden of Gethsemane Christ submitted completely to the Father’s will—  E\neven though He faced the cross and the sins of the world were crushing out His life.\nAs He cried out to God, “Take this cup from me,” He remained surrendered in His\npleading, and added, “Yet not what I will, but what you will” (Mark 14:36).\nChrist longs for us to experience the fulfillment that a truly surrendered life\nbrings. And He also wants us to experience the joy of Sabbath rest. He wants us to\ntrust Him enough to obey Him in all the details of life. If you answer God’s call and\nobey all of His commandments, you will experience the promise of Jesus that His joy\nwill “be in you” and “your joy” will “be complete” (John 15:11).\n, www.biblestudies.com\ni www.bibleinfo.com\n: The Voice of Prophecy Bible School, USA\n\n\ne ———————————————— .. e A . |\nCAN THE MAJORITY BE WRONG? |\nRead through DISCOVER Guide 21.
