He’s been hungry, thirsty, tempted, and exhausted. He’s felt the need for\nsympathy and understanding.\nBut above all, Jesus is qualified to be our High Priest because He died to “make\natonement” for our sins. He paid the price for our sins by dying in our place. This is the\nGospel, the Good News for all human beings everywhere and for all time. |\n/ One of our Bible School directors shares this experience: “When our youngest\ndaughter was three, she caught her finger in a folding chair, splintering the bone.

She sobbed, ‘Oh, Daddy, I wish it could have been my finger!””\nWhen all humanity were crushed by sin and condemned to die eternally, Jesus said, |\n' “Oh, Father, I wish it could have been Me.” And the Father gave Jesus His wish at the\ncross. Our Savior has experienced every agony we have suffered—and more! |",

THE GOSPEL IN THE OLD TESTAMENT\n| When the people of Israel camped at the foot of Mount Sinai, God instructed Moses\nto build a portable sanctuary for worship “according to the pattern shown you [Moses]\non the mountain” (Exodus 25:40). Nearly 500 years later, King Solomon’s great stone\ntemple replaced the portable sanctuary. And the temple was built on precisely the same\nplan as the portable sanctuary. - '\n’ When God gave Moses the directions for building the sanctuary, what specific\n\n\npurpose did He have in mind? . |\n“Then have them make a sanctuary for me, and I WILL DWELL AMONG THEM.” |\n| —Exodus 25:8. ; |\nSin caused a tragic separation between human beings and their Creator. The\nsanctuary was God’s way of showing how He can again live among us. The sanctuary, and |\nlater the temple, became the center of religious life and worship in Old Testament times. 3\nEach morning and evening the people could gather around the sanctuary and establish\ncontact with God in prayer (Luke 1:9, 10), claiming God’s promise: “I will meet with you”\n(Exodus 30:6). |\nThe Old Testament teaches the same gospel of salvation as does the New Testament. | |\nBoth portray Jesus dying for us and ministering to us as our High Priest in the heavenly\nsanctuary. ‘ - ,"

            "text": "‘The sanctuary and its services reveal what Jesus is doing now in the temple in heaven,\nand what He is doing now on earth to enrich and guide each of us in our daily lives. |\n| Since the earthly sanctuary was patterned after the temple in heaven, it reflects the\nheavenly sanctuary where Christ now ministers. Exodus 25-40 describes the services and\nceremonies of the wilderness sanctuary in great detail. A brief summary of the sanctuary\nfurnishings appears in the New Testament: :\n‘ “Now the first covenant hiad regulations for worship and also an earthly\nsanctuary.. .. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated ' .\no bread; this was called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a room called the\nMost Holy Place, which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the\n| covenant. This ark contained . .. the stone tablets of the covenant [on which God\nwrote the Ten Commandments (Deuteronomy 10:1-5)]. Above the ark were the\ncherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover [mercy seat].” ‘\n| — Hebrews 9:1-5.\nThe sanctuary had two rooms, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place. A courtyard\nwas laid out in front of the sanctuary. In the court stood the brass altar on which the |\npriests offered sacrifices, and the laver in which they washed.\nThe sacrifices offered on the brass altar symbolized Jesus, who through His death on\nthe cross became “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29).\nWhen the repentant sinner came to the altar with his sacrifice and confessed his sins, he\nreceived forgiveness and cleansing. In the same way, the sinner today obtains forgiveness\nand cleansing through the blood of Jesus (1 John 1:9).\nIn the first room, or Holy Place, the seven-branched lampstand burned continually,\nrepresenting Jesus as the never-failing “light of the world” (John 8:12). The table of\nconsecrated bread symbolized His satisfying our physical and spiritual hunger as the ever-\n| present “Bread of Life” (John 6:35). The golden altar of incense represented Jesus’ prayer\nministry for us in the very presence of God (Revelation 8:3, 4). e\nThe second room, or Most Holy Place, contained the gold-covered ark of the covenant.\nIt symbolized the throne of God. Its atonement cover, or mercy seat, represented the\n| intercession of Christ, our High Priest, interceding on behalf of sinful human beings who\nhave broken God’s moral law. The two tablets of stone on which God wrote the Ten\nCommandments were kept below the mercy seat. Golden cherubim of glory hovered over\nthe mercy seat on each end of the ark. A glorious light shone between these two cherubim,\na symbol of the presence of God Himself. o\n' A curtain hid the Holy Place from the view of the people as the priests ministered to\nSl F = . -\n\n\nthem in the courtyard. A second curtain in front of the Most Holy Place blocked |\nthis inner room from the priests who entered the sanctuary’s first room.\nWhen Jesus died on the cross, what happened to the curtain? |\n“At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to\nbottom.” —Matthew 27:51. ' .\nThe Most Holy Place was exposed when Jesus died. After the death of Jesus no\ncurtain can come between a holy God and a sincere believer; Jesus, our High ~ * y\nPriest, ushers us into the very presence of God (Hebrews 10:19-22). We have\naccess to the throne room of heaven because Jesus is our High Priest at God’s\nright hand. Jesus enables us to come into God’s presence—into the Father’s heart | ‘\nof love. So “let us draw near” |\n, 4. A REVELATION OF CHRIST DYING TO SAVE US\nJust as the earthly sanctuary served as a miniature reproduction of the\nheavenly temple where ]esug«now ministers for us, the services carried on in the\nearthly sanctuary were “a copy and shadow of what is in heaven” (Hebrews 8:5). | .\n’ But there is a striking difference: The priests who served in the earthly temple )\ncould not themselves forgive sin, but at the cross Jesus “appeared once for all at ‘\nthe end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself” (Hebrews\n‘ 9:26). | |\nThe Old Testament book of Leviticus describes in detail the services carried\non in the sanctuary. The ceremonial rituals were divided into two parts: the daily\nservices and the yearly services. (Guide 13 deals with the yearly services.) A\nIn the daily services, the priests offered sacrifices for the individual and for\nthe entire congregation. When a person sinned, he would bring an unblemished\nanimal as a sin offering, “lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and\nslaughter it at the place of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:29). The guilt of the\nsinner must be transferred to the guiltless animal by confession of sin and the |\nlaying on of hands. This symbolized Christ taking on our guilt at Calvary; the\nsinless One became “sin for us” (2 Corinthians 5:21). The sacrificial animal had |\nto be killed and its blood shed because it pointed forward to the supreme penalty\nthat Christ suffered on the cross. | |"

            "text": "“Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness” (Hebrews 9:22).\n' What happened in the Old Testament sanctuary pointed forward to Christ’s one\ngreat saving act. Having died for our sins, He entered the holy places “once for all |\nby his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption” for us (verse 12). When\nJesus’ blood was shed on the cross for our sins, “the curtain of the temple [in\n| Jerusalem| was torn in two from top to bottom” (Matthew 27:51). Because of\nJesus’ sacrifice on the cross, animal sacrifices were no longer necessary. |\nWhen Jesus spilled His blood from the cross, He was offering up His perfectly |\nobedient life as a substitute for our failures. When the Father and Son were torn\napart at Calvary, the Father turned away in anguish and the Son died of a broken '\n‘ heart.

He is now\nworking diligently to save every human being from the tragedy of sin. Some |\nmistakenly assume that, as our Intercessor, Jesus is in heaven begging a reluctant\nGod to forgive us. In fact, it is God who joyfully accepts His Son’s sacrifice on |\nour behalf. |\nAs our High Priest in heaven, Christ also pleads with humanity. He works to\nhelp the indifferent take a second look at grace, to help despairing sinners grasp\nhope in the gospel, and to help believers find more riches in the Word of God\nand more power in prayer. Jesus is molding our lives in harmony with God’s |\ncommandments and helping us develop characters that will stand the test of\ntime.\nGod laid down His life for every person who has ever lived in this world.\n‘ And now, as High Priest or Mediator, “He always lives” to lead people to accept\nHis death for their sins.
