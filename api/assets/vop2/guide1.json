            "number": 1,
            "text": "The design of the human body\ndemands the existence of a designer.\nScientists tell us that the brain stores\nand remembers thousands of mental\nimages, integrates and solves\nproblems, appreciates beauty,\ncomprehends self, and desires to\ndevelop the best in each person.\nElectrical charges originating from the\nbrain control all the muscular activity\nof our bodies.\n\nComputers also function through\nelectrical impulses. But it took a.\nhuman mind to invent the computer\nand a human being to build the\ncomputer and tell it what to do.\n\nNo wonder the psalmist concluded\nthat the human body speaks loud and\nclear of a wonderful Creator:\n\n“I praise you because I am\nfearfully and wonderfully made;\nyour works are wonderful, I know\nthat full well.” —Psalm139:14.\n\n\n(Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are from the\nNew International Version of the Bible [NIV].)\n\nWe don't have to go far to find the “works” of God. The intricate design of the\nhuman brain and the other organs of our body are the “works” of God, and point\nto an infinitely skillful designer.\n\nNo pump built by man can compare with the human heart. No computer\nnetwork can equal our nervous system. No television system is as efficient as the\nhuman voice, ear, and eye. No central air conditioning and heating system can\nmatch the work done by our nose, lungs, and skin. The complexity of the human\nbody suggests that someone designed it, and that Someone is God.\n\nThe human body is a complete system of organs—all interrelated, all\nthoroughly designed. The lungs and heart, nerves and muscles, all perform\nincredibly complicated tasks that depend on other incredibly complicated tasks.\n\nIf you were to mark ten coins from one to ten, put them in your pocket, sMake\nthem around, and then pull them out and put them back in your pocket one by\none, what is the likelihood you could do so in exact numerical sequence? By\nmathematical law you have only one chance in ten billion of taking them out in\norder from one to ten. ‘\n\nNow consider the chances of a stomach, brain, heart, liver, arteries, veins,\nkidneys, ears, eyes, and teeth all developing together and beginning to function at\nthe same moment in time.\n\nWhat is the most reasonable explanation for the design of the human body?\n\n“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,...SO\nGOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE, . .. male and female he created\nthem.” ~\n—Genesis 1:26, 27.\n\nThe first man and woman could not just have happened. The Bible affirms\nthat God designed us in His image. He thought us up and brought us into being."

            "text": "But evidence for God is not confined to the design of our bodies; it’s also\nspread across the heavens. Leave the lights of the city, and look up into the night\nsky. That milky cloud beyond the stars that we call the Milky Way is really a\ngalaxy of billions of blazing suns similar to our sun. In fact our sun and its\n\n~ planets are a part of the Milky Way. And our Milky Way is but one of an estimated\nmore than one hundred billion galaxies that can be seen through giant telescopes\non earth and through the Hubble telescope in space.\n\nNo wonder the psalmist concluded that the stars speak of a glorious Maker:\n\n“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his\nhands.” —Psalm 19:1-3. |\n\nWhat may we reasonably conclude by looking at the intricate design and vast\nsize of the universe? | |\n\n“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” — Genesis I:1.\n\n“[God] is before all things, and in him all things hold together.”\n—Colossians 1:17.\n\nAll creation testifies about God the Master Designer and Infinite Creator. In\nthe simple words, “in the beginning God,” we find the answer to the mystery of\nlife. There is a God who created everything.\n\nMany great scientific minds today believe in God. Dr. Arthur Compton, Nobel\nPrize-winning physicist, commenting on this verse of Scripture, once said:\n\n\n|\n“For myself, faith begins with a realization that a supreme intelligence brought the | |\n‘ universe into being and created man. It is not difficult for me to have this faith, for it ';\n‘ is plain that where there is a plan there is a divine intelligence. An orderly, unfolding e\nuniverse testifies to the truth of the most majestic statement ever uttered—In the | .\nbeginning God.” |\nThe Bible does not attempt to prove God—it declares His existence. Dr. Arthur |\n, | Conklin, a noted biologist, once wrote: “The probability of life originating from an |\n' accident is comparable to the probability of an unabridged dictionary resulting from\n. an explosion in a print shop.” ' ' e E\n| We know that human beings can’t make something from nothing. We may build\nthings, invent things, put things together, but we have never brought into being from R '\n' | ' scratch even the tiniest frog or the simplest flower. The things about us cry out that | i\n, God designed, God created, God sustains. The only believable answer to the origin of -3 ' |\nthe universe, this world, and human beings—is God. : ' o\nit | 3. GOD COMES INTO PERSONAL = o e o\n| RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE ' ' -\n| The God who designed the starry heavens, who created the universe, seeks a | -\npersonal relationship with us. He had a personal relationship with Moses: “The Lord | - k\nwould speak to Moses . .. as a man speaks with his friend” (Exodus 33:11). And God | -\nwants to enter into a personal relationship with you and become your Friend. Jesus :\npromised those who follow Him: “You are my friends” (John 15:14). | . 12\n| We have all wrestled with the idea of God, for humans are naturally religious. No |\nanimal ever builds an altar for worship. Yet everywhere you find men and women, you ;\nfind them worshiping. Deep within every human heart is a natural desire to worship,\n: an awareness of God, a desire to become a friend of God. When we respond to our \\\n‘ , longing and find God, there is no longer a doubt about His existence and our need. -\nDuring the 1990s millions of atheists in Russia renounced atheism and turned to | | |\n| ~God. A university professor in St. Petersburg made a statement that typifies the\n! | - comments made by many transformed atheists in the former Soviet Union:\n| “I have searched for a meaning to life in my scientific research, but found nothing '\n| to have confidence in. The scientists around me have the same empty feeling. As I -\nlooked at the vastness of the universe in my study of astronomy, and the emptiness of\n| my soul, I felt there must be some meaning. Then, when I received the Bible you gave\n- me and began reading it, the vacuum in my life was filled. I have found the Bible to be |\n| the only source of confidence to my soul. I have accepted Jesus as my Savior and have | P\n~ found true peace and satisfaction in life” |\n: A Christian believes in God because he or she has met Him and discovers that He | |\n| . satisfies the heart’s deepest needs. The God whom Christians have joyfully found to ! - |\n| exist, gives us a new perspective, new meaning, new motives, and new joys. :\n| God doesn’'t promise a life free from trouble and conflict, but He does assure us | ey\n| that He will guide and sustain us if we come into a personal relationship with Him. ‘\nf ‘ - And millions of Christians will testify that they would give up everything rather than |\n-go back to a life without God. | 3 |\n|  This is the greatest wonder of all—that the Almighty God who designed, created, |\n| and sustains the universe also desires a personal relationship with every man and 8\nwoman, boy and girl. David marvelled at this, when he wrote: _ |\n“When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the |\nR i stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him?” | '\n| — Psalm 8:3, 4. Lo s |\nS e s s e i\n_ . , ,\n\n\n- Our Creator is “mindful” of each one of us. He takes as personal an interest | -\n~ in you as if you were the only being He had created. | | |\n| | So we can believe in God: (1) Because of the intricate design in everything | | | o\n| He created about us. (2) Because of the longing for God within us that leaves us i h | -\n< restless till we find our rest in Him. And, (3) Because when we seek and find |\nHim, God satisfies our every need and longing—to the full! | o j"

            "text": "It is only reasonable that a personal God would want to reveal Himself to His |\ncreated beings just as a father desires that his children know him.
