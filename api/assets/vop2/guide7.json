God presented an\n| e % - #\n] Y outline of world history in advance for\n: 2,500 years, from Daniel’s time to our\n| - own day.\no - SR BalE W This prophecy originated in a\n\n\n‘F_——__——_-_———__\"\ndream God gave Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, some 2,500 years ago. The |\ndream deeply troubled this monarch—but he couldn’t remember the dream when he\nwoke up! After all of Babylon’s wise men failed to help the king recall his dream or\ninterpret it, a young Hebrew exile named Daniel arrived on the scene, claiming that the\nGod of Heaven could reveal all mysteries. 1\nStanding before the king, Daniel boldly declared:\n“You looked, O king, and there before you stood A LARGE STATUE—an\nenormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance.\n“The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly\nand thighs of bronze, its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. AT\n“While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck\nthe statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them.\n“Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to\npieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. |\nThe wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But THE ROCK THAT STRUCK |\n~ THE STATUE became a huge mountain and FILLED THE WHOLE EARTH.” —\nDaniel 2:31-35. (Unless otherwise noted, all Scriptural texts in the DISCOVER guides are |\n| from the New International Version of the Bible [NIV].) . |\nThis statue, at first glance, may seem to have little to do with finding hope in\ncontemporary times, but hold on. 0 i"

            "text": "After telling a very impressed Nebuchadnezzar exactly what hed seen in his vision, *\no the prophet Daniel explained: | _\n| “This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king.”\n, —Daniel2:36. : ' o\nTHE HEAD OF GOLD: What world power did Daniel tell the king the head of\n| gold symbolized?\n| | “You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion\nand power and might and glory. ... YOU ARE THAT HEAD OF GOLD.” —Verses 37,\n| 38.\nDaniel was saying to the ruler of that world’s greatest empire: “Nebuchadnezzar, |\nGod is telling you that your empire, Babylon, is represented by the statue’s golden head.”\nTHE CHEST AND ARMS OF SILVER: From a human perspective Babylon\nlooked like an empire that would last forever. But what does the prophecy say would\n| happen next?\nLS, “After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours.” — Verse 39.\nIn fulfillment of God’s prediction, Nebuchadnezzar’s kingdom crumbled into ruins\nwhen Cyrus, the Persian general, overthrew the Babylonian empire in 539 B.C. So the\nchest and arms of silver represent Medo-Persia, another mighty empire.\nTHE BELLY AND THIGHS OF BRONZE: What does this part of the great metal |\nimage represent?\n“Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.”\n— Verse 39.\nThe belly and thighs of bronze of the image symbolize the kingdom of Greece. i\nAlexander the Great conquered the Medes and the Persians, turning Greece into the\n| world’s third great empire. She ruled from 331 to 168 B.C.\nTHE LEGS OF IRON: .\n_ “Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom [said the prophet], strong as iron—for\niron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will\ne s e B\n= - - - - .. - = = = =\n\n\ncrush and break all the others.” — Verse 40. B\nAfter the death of Alexander, his empire weakened and split into rival factions until |\nfinally in 168 B.C., at the battle of Pydna, the “Iron Empire” of Rome crushed Greece. ;\nCaesar Augustus ruled the Roman Empire when Jesus was born about two thousand E |\nyears ago (Luke 2:1). Christ and His apostles lived during the period represented by the ]\nlegs of iron. Gibbon, the eighteenth-century historian, no doubt had Daniel’s prophecy in 1 | _\nmind when he wrote: “The images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to represent 1\nthe nations and their kings, were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome.”— |\nEdward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (John D. Morris e\nand Company), vol. 4, p. 89. - -\nThink for a moment about this prediction from a human point of view. Howy could o\nDaniel, living in the time of Babylon, have any idea of how many empires would succeed 8\neach other hundreds of years in the future? We have a hard time figuring out what the .\nstock market is going to do next week! And yet Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome ; |\nfollowed each other exactly as predicted—Ilike obedient schoolboys in a line. ] |\n| Is God in control of the future? Can we have hope on the basis of His grand plan? The ~ |\ni ‘ answer is a resounding, Yes! ' i :\nTHE FEET AND TOES OF IRON MIXED WITH CLAY: Would a fifth world power :' E 5\nfollow Rome? ' : | |\n“Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, e\n: so THIS WILL BE A DIVIDED KINGDOM,; yet it will have some of the strength of iron «\n» in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. As the toes were partly iron and partly -\nclay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.” —Daniel 2:41, 42. : |\n: The prophet predicted, not a fifth world empire, but a division of the iron monarchy of ; |\n' Rome. Rome would fracture into ten kingdoms, as symbolized by the feet and toes of the 1 :\nimage. , :\n. ' Did this actually happen? It certainly did. During the fourth and fifth centuries of the '\nChristian Era barbaric invaders from the north poured down on the decaying Roman _ |\nEmpire, delivering blow after blow. Finally ten of the tribes gained most of the territory of .\nWestern Rome, and ten distinct, independent nations established themselves within the |\n' boundaries of Europe. Thus the toes symbolize the modern nations of Europe today. ]"

She was the only one who did\nnot shout, weep, or bargain with Heaven.
