["<FR>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.<Fr>","<FR>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every <FI>branch<Fi> that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.<Fr>","<FR>Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.<Fr>","<FR>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.<Fr>","<FR>I am the vine, ye <FI>are<Fi> the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.<Fr><RF>without me: or, severed from me<Rf>","<FR>If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast <FI>them<Fi> into the fire, and they are burned.<Fr>","<FR>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.<Fr>","<FR>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.<Fr><CM>","<FR>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.<Fr>","<FR>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<Fr>","<FR>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and <FI>that<Fi> your joy might be full.<Fr>","<FR>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.<Fr>","<FR>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.<Fr>","<FR>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.<Fr>","<FR>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<Fr>","<FR>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and <FI>that<Fi> your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.<Fr>","<FR>These things I command you, that ye love one another.<Fr><CM>","<FR>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before <FI>it hated<Fi> you.<Fr>","<FR>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.<Fr>","<FR>Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord.
