And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.","And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.","And he told <FI>it<Fi> to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What <FI>is<Fi> this dream that thou hast dreamed?
