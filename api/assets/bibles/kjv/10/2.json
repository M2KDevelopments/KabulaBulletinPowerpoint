["And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.","So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.","And his men that <FI>were<Fi> with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.","And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, <FI>That<Fi> the men of Jabeshgilead <FI>were they<Fi> that buried Saul.","And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed <FI>be<Fi> ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, <FI>even<Fi> unto Saul, and have buried him.","And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.","Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.<RF>be ye…: Heb. be ye the sons of valour<Rf><CM>","But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;<RF>Saul's host: Heb. the host which was Saul's<Rf><RF>Ishbosheth: or, Eshbaal<Rf>","And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.","Ishbosheth Saul's son <FI>was<Fi> forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.","And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.<RF>time: Heb. number of days<Rf>","And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.","And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.<RF>together: Heb. them together<Rf>","And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.","Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which <FI>pertained<Fi> to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.","And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and <FI>thrust<Fi> his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which <FI>is<Fi> in Gibeon.<RF>Helkathhazzurim: that is, The field of strong men<Rf>","And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.<CM>","And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel <FI>was as<Fi> light of foot as a wild roe.<RF>of foot: Heb. of his feet<Rf><RF>as a wild…: Heb. as one of the roes that is in the field<Rf>","And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.<RF>from…: Heb. from after Abner<Rf>","Then Abner looked behind him, and said, <FI>Art<Fi> thou Asahel?
