["Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:","And I will come upon him while he <FI>is<Fi> weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that <FI>are<Fi> with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:","And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest <FI>is<Fi> as if all returned: <FI>so<Fi> all the people shall be in peace.","And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.<RF>pleased…: Heb. was right in the eyes of, etc<Rf>","Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.<RF>what…: Heb. what is in his mouth<Rf>","And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do <FI>after<Fi> his saying? if not; speak thou.<RF>his saying: Heb. his word<Rf>","And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given <FI>is<Fi> not good at this time.<RF>given: Heb. counselled<Rf>","For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they <FI>be<Fi> mighty men, and they <FI>be<Fi> chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father <FI>is<Fi> a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.<RF>chafed…: Heb. bitter of soul<Rf>","Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some <FI>other<Fi> place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.<RF>overthrown: Heb. fallen<Rf>","And he also <FI>that is<Fi> valiant, whose heart <FI>is<Fi> as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father <FI>is<Fi> a mighty man, and <FI>they<Fi> which <FI>be<Fi> with him <FI>are<Fi> valiant men.","Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that <FI>is<Fi> by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.<RF>that thou…: Heb. that thy face, or, presence go, etc<Rf>","So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that <FI>are<Fi> with him there shall not be left so much as one.","Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.","And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite <FI>is<Fi> better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.<RF>appointed: Heb. commanded<Rf><CM>","Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.","Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that <FI>are<Fi> with him.","Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.","Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.","And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.","And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where <FI>is<Fi> Ahimaaz and Jonathan?
