["For we know that if our earthly house of <FI>this<Fi> tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.","For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:","If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.","For we that are in <FI>this<Fi> tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.","Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing <FI>is<Fi> God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.","Therefore <FI>we are<Fi> always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:","(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)","We are confident, <FI>I say<Fi>, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.","Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.<RF>labour: or, endeavour<Rf>","For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things <FI>done<Fi> in <FI>his<Fi> body, according to that he hath done, whether <FI>it be<Fi> good or bad.","Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.<CM>","For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to <FI>answer<Fi> them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.<RF>in appearance: Gr. in the face<Rf>","For whether we be beside ourselves, <FI>it is<Fi> to God: or whether we be sober, <FI>it is<Fi> for your cause.","For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:","And <FI>that<Fi> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.<CM>","Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we <FI>him<Fi> no more.","Therefore if any man <FI>be<Fi> in Christ, <FI>he is<Fi> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.<RF>he is: or, let him be<Rf>","And all things <FI>are<Fi> of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;","To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.<RF>committedâ€¦: Gr. put in us<Rf>","Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech <FI>you<Fi> by us: we pray <FI>you<Fi> in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.","For he hath made him <FI>to be<Fi> sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.<CM>"]
