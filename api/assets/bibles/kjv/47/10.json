["Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence <FI>am<Fi> base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:<RF>in presence: or, in outward appearance<Rf>","But I beseech <FI>you<Fi>, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.<RF>think: or, reckon<Rf>","For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:","(For the weapons of our warfare <FI>are<Fi> not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)<RF>through God: or, to God<Rf>","Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;<RF>imaginations: or, reasonings<Rf>","And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.<CM>","Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he <FI>is<Fi> Christ's, even so <FI>are<Fi> we Christ's.","For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:","That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.","For <FI>his<Fi> letters, say they, <FI>are<Fi> weighty and powerful; but <FI>his<Fi> bodily presence <FI>is<Fi> weak, and <FI>his<Fi> speech contemptible.<RF>say they: Gr. saith he<Rf>","Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <FI>will we be<Fi> also in deed when we are present.<CM>","For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.<RF>are…: or, understand it not<Rf>","But we will not boast of things without <FI>our<Fi> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.<RF>rule: or, line<Rf>","For we stretch not ourselves beyond <FI>our measure<Fi>, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in <FI>preaching<Fi> the gospel of Christ:","Not boasting of things without <FI>our<Fi> measure, <FI>that is<Fi>, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,<RF>enlarged…: or, magnified in you<Rf>","To preach the gospel in the <FI>regions<Fi> beyond you, <FI>and<Fi> not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.<RF>line: or, rule<Rf>","<FO>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.<Fo>","For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.<CM>"]
