["Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;","How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.<RF>liberality: Gr. simplicity<Rf>","For to <FI>their<Fi> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond <FI>their<Fi> power <FI>they were<Fi> willing of themselves;","Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and <FI>take upon us<Fi> the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.","And <FI>this they did<Fi>, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.","Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.<RF>grace: or, gift<Rf><CM>","Therefore, as ye abound in every <FI>thing, in<Fi> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <FI>in<Fi> all diligence, and <FI>in<Fi> your love to us, <FI>see<Fi> that ye abound in this grace also.","I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.","For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.","And herein I give <FI>my<Fi> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.<RF>forward: Gr. willing<Rf>","Now therefore perform the doing <FI>of it<Fi>; that as <FI>there was<Fi> a readiness to will, so <FI>there may be<Fi> a performance also out of that which ye have.","For if there be first a willing mind, <FI>it is<Fi> accepted according to that a man hath, <FI>and<Fi> not according to that he hath not.","For <FI>I mean<Fi> not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:","But by an equality, <FI>that<Fi> now at this time your abundance <FI>may be a supply<Fi> for their want, that their abundance also may be <FI>a supply<Fi> for your want: that there may be equality:","As it is written, <FO>He that <FI>had gathered<Fi> much had nothing over; and he that <FI>had gathered<Fi> little had no lack.<Fo><CM>","But thanks <FI>be<Fi> to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.","For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.","And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise <FI>is<Fi> in the gospel throughout all the churches;","And not <FI>that<Fi> only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and <FI>declaration of<Fi> your ready mind:<RF>grace: or, gift<Rf>","Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:","Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.","And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which <FI>I have<Fi> in you.<RF>I have: or, he hath<Rf>","Whether <FI>any do enquire<Fi> of Titus, <FI>he is<Fi> my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren <FI>be enquired of, they are<Fi> the messengers of the churches, <FI>and<Fi> the glory of Christ.","Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.<CM>"]
