But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.","So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.","And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil <FI>is<Fi> upon us.
