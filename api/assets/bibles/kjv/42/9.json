And he said to his disciples, <FR>Make them sit down by fifties in a company.<Fr>","And they did so, and made them all sit down.","Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.","And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.<CM>","And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, <FR>Whom say the people that I am?<Fr>","They answering said, John the Baptist; but some <FI>say<Fi>, Elias; and others <FI>say<Fi>, that one of the old prophets is risen again.","He said unto them, <FR>But whom say ye that I am?<Fr> Peter answering said, The Christ of God.","And he straitly charged them, and commanded <FI>them<Fi> to tell no man that thing;","Saying, <FR>The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.<Fr>","And he said to <FI>them<Fi> all, <FR>If any <FI>man<Fi> will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.<Fr>","<FR>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.<Fr>","<FR>For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?<Fr>","<FR>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and <FI>in his<Fi> Father's, and of the holy angels.<Fr>","<FR>But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.<Fr><CM>","And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.<RF>sayings: or, things<Rf>","And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment <FI>was<Fi> white <FI>and<Fi> glistering.","And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:","Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.","But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.","And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.","While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.","And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.","And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept <FI>it<Fi> close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.<CM>","And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.","And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.","And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.","And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.","And Jesus answering said, <FR>O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you?
