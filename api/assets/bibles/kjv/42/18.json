["And he spake a parable unto them <FI>to this end<Fi>, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;","Saying, <FR>There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:<Fr><RF>in a city: Gr. in a certain city<Rf>","<FR>And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.<Fr>","<FR>And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;<Fr>","<FR>Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.<Fr>","And the Lord said, <FR>Hear what the unjust judge saith.<Fr>","<FR>And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?<Fr>","<FR>I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?<Fr><CM>","And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:<RF>thatâ€¦: or, as being righteous<Rf>","<FR>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.<Fr>","<FR>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men <FI>are<Fi>, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.<Fr>","<FR>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.<Fr>","<FR>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as <FI>his<Fi> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.<Fr>","<FR>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified <FI>rather<Fi> than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.<Fr><CM>","And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when <FI>his<Fi> disciples saw <FI>it<Fi>, they rebuked them.","But Jesus called them <FI>unto him<Fi>, and said, <FR>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.<Fr>","<FR>Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.<Fr><CM>","And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?","And Jesus said unto him, <FR>Why callest thou me good? none <FI>is<Fi> good, save one, <FI>that is<Fi>, God.<Fr>","<FR>Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.<Fr>","And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.","Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, <FR>Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.<Fr>","And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.","And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, <FR>How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!<Fr>","<FR>For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<Fr>","And they that heard <FI>it<Fi> said, Who then can be saved?","And he said, <FR>The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.<Fr>","Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.","And he said unto them, <FR>Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,<Fr>","<FR>Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.<Fr><CM>","Then he took <FI>unto him<Fi> the twelve, and said unto them, <FR>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.<Fr>","<FR>For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:<Fr>","<FR>And they shall scourge <FI>him<Fi>, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.<Fr>","And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.<CM>","And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:","And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.","And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.","And he cried, saying, Jesus, <FI>thou<Fi> Son of David, have mercy on me.","And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, <FI>Thou<Fi> Son of David, have mercy on me.","And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,","Saying, <FR>What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?<Fr> And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.","And Jesus said unto him,<FR> Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.<Fr>","And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw <FI>it<Fi>, gave praise unto God.<CM>"]
