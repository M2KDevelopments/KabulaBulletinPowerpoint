["And he said also unto his disciples, <FR>There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.<Fr>","<FR>And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.<Fr>","<FR>Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.<Fr>","<FR>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.<Fr>","<FR>So he called every one of his lord's debtors <FI>unto him<Fi>, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?<Fr>","<FR>And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.<Fr><RF>measures: the word Batus in the original containeth nine gallons three quarts<Rf>","<FR>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.<Fr><RF>measures: the word here interpreted a measure in the original containeth about fourteen bushels and two quarts<Rf>","<FR>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.<Fr>","<FR>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.<Fr><RF>mammon: or, riches<Rf>","<FR>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.<Fr>","<FR>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <FI>riches<Fi>?<Fr><RF>mammon: or, riches<Rf>","<FR>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?<Fr>","<FR>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.<Fr>","And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.","And he said unto them, <FR>Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.<Fr>","<FR>The law and the prophets <FI>were<Fi> until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.<Fr>","<FR>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.<Fr>","<FR>Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from <FI>her<Fi> husband committeth adultery.<Fr><CM>","<FR> There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:<Fr>","<FR>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,<Fr>","<FR>And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.<Fr>","<FR>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;<Fr>","<FR>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.<Fr>","<FR>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.<Fr>","<FR>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.<Fr>","<FR>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that <FI>would come<Fi> from thence.<Fr>","<FR>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:<Fr>","<FR>For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.<Fr>","<FR>Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.<Fr>","<FR>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.<Fr>","<FR>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.<Fr><CM>"]
