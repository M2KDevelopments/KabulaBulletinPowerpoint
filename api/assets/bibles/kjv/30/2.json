["Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away <FI>the punishment<Fi> thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:","But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, <FI>and<Fi> with the sound of the trumpet:","And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.","Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away <FI>the punishment<Fi> thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:","But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.","Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away <FI>the punishment<Fi> thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;","That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the <FI>same<Fi> maid, to profane my holy name:<RF>maid: or, young woman<Rf>","And they lay <FI>themselves<Fi> down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned <FI>in<Fi> the house of their god.<RF>the condemned: or, such as have fined, or, mulcted<Rf><CM>","Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height <FI>was<Fi> like the height of the cedars, and he <FI>was<Fi> strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.","Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.","And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. <FI>Is it<Fi> not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.","But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.","Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed <FI>that is<Fi> full of sheaves.<RF>I amâ€¦: or, I will press your place, as a cart full of sheaves presseth<Rf>","Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:<RF>himself: Heb. his soul, or, life<Rf>","Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and <FI>he that is<Fi> swift of foot shall not deliver <FI>himself<Fi>: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.","And <FI>he that is<Fi> courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.<RF>courageous: Heb. strong of his heart<Rf><CM>"]
