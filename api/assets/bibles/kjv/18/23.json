["Then Job answered and said,","Even to day <FI>is<Fi> my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.<RF>stroke: Heb. hand<Rf>","Oh that I knew where I might find him! <FI>that<Fi> I might come <FI>even<Fi> to his seat!","I would order <FI>my<Fi> cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.","I would know the words <FI>which<Fi> he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.","Will he plead against me with <FI>his<Fi> great power? No; but he would put <FI>strength<Fi> in me.","There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.<CM>","Behold, I go forward, but he <FI>is<Fi> not <FI>there<Fi>; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:","On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold <FI>him<Fi>: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see <FI>him<Fi>:","But he knoweth the way that I take: <FI>when<Fi> he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.<RF>that…: Heb. that is with me<Rf>","My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.","Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary <FI>food<Fi>.<RF>esteemed: Heb. hid, or, laid up<Rf><RF>my…: or, my appointed portion<Rf><CM>","But he <FI>is<Fi> in one <FI>mind<Fi>, and who can turn him? and <FI>what<Fi> his soul desireth, even <FI>that<Fi> he doeth.","For he performeth <FI>the thing that is<Fi> appointed for me: and many such <FI>things are<Fi> with him.","Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.","For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:","Because I was not cut off before the darkness, <FI>neither<Fi> hath he covered the darkness from my face.<CM>"]
