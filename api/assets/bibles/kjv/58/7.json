["For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;","To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;","Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.<RF>without descent: Gr. without pedigree<Rf>","Now consider how great this man <FI>was<Fi>, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.","And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:","But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.<RF>descent: or, pedigree<Rf>","And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.","And here men that die receive tithes; but there he <FI>receiveth them<Fi>, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.","And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.","For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.<CM>","If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need <FI>was there<Fi> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?","For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.","For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.","For <FI>it is<Fi> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.","And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,","Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.","For he testifieth, <FO>Thou <FI>art<Fi> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<Fo>","For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.","For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope <FI>did<Fi>; by the which we draw nigh unto God.<RF>the bringing…: or, it was the bringing in<Rf>","And inasmuch as not without an oath <FI>he was made priest<Fi>:","(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, <FO>The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou <FI>art<Fi> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:<Fo>)<RF>without…: or, without swearing of an oath<Rf>","By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.","And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:","But this <FI>man<Fi>, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.<RF>an…: or, which passeth not from one to another<Rf>","Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.<RF>to the…: or, evermore<Rf>","For such an high priest became us, <FI>who is<Fi> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;","Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.","For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <FI>maketh<Fi> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.<RF>consecrated: Gr. perfected<Rf><CM>"]
