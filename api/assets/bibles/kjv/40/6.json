Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<Fr>","<FR>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.<Fr>","<FR>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen <FI>do<Fi>: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.<Fr>","<FR>Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.<Fr><CM>","<FR>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<Fr>","<FR>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as <FI>it is<Fi> in heaven.<Fr>","<FR>Give us this day our daily bread.<Fr>","<FR>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<Fr>","<FR>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
