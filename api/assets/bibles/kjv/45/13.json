["Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.<RF>ordained: or, ordered<Rf>","Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.","For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:","For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to <FI>execute<Fi> wrath upon him that doeth evil.","Wherefore <FI>ye<Fi> must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.","For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.<CM>","Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute <FI>is due<Fi>; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.","Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.","For this, <FO>Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet;<Fo> and if <FI>there be<Fi> any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, <FO>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<Fo>","Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love <FI>is<Fi> the fulfilling of the law.<CM>","And that, knowing the time, that now <FI>it is<Fi> high time to awake out of sleep: for now <FI>is<Fi> our salvation nearer than when we believed.","The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.","Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.<RF>honestly: or, decently<Rf>","But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to <FI>fulfil<Fi> the lusts <FI>thereof<Fi>.<CM>"]
