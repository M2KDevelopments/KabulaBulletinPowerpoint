["And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, <FI>even<Fi> as unto babes in Christ.","I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able <FI>to bear it<Fi>, neither yet now are ye able.","For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <FI>there is<Fi> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?<RF>divisions: or, factions<Rf><RF>as men: Gr. according to man?<Rf>","For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I <FI>am<Fi> of Apollos; are ye not carnal?<CM>","Who then is Paul, and who <FI>is<Fi> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?","I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.","So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.","Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.","For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, <FI>ye are<Fi> God's building.<RF>husbandry: or, tillage<Rf>","According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<CM>","For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.","Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;","Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.<RF>it shall be: Gr. it is<Rf>","If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.","If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.<CM>","Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <FI>that<Fi> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?","If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <FI>temple<Fi> ye are.<RF>defile: or, destroy<Rf><CM>","Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.","For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, <FO>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.<Fo>","And again, <FO>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.<Fo><CM>","Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;","Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;","And ye are Christ's; and Christ <FI>is<Fi> God's.<CM>"]
