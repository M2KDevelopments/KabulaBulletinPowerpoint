["Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.","Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.","But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.<RF>judgment: Gr. day<Rf>","For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.<RF>know: or, I am not conscious of any fault<Rf>","Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.","And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <FI>to<Fi> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <FI>of men<Fi> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.<CM>","For who maketh thee to differ <FI>from another<Fi>? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive <FI>it<Fi>, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <FI>it<Fi>?<RF>makethâ€¦: Gr. distinguisheth thee<Rf>","Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.","For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.<RF>spectacle: Gr. theatre<Rf>","We <FI>are<Fi> fools for Christ's sake, but ye <FI>are<Fi> wise in Christ; we <FI>are<Fi> weak, but ye <FI>are<Fi> strong; ye <FI>are<Fi> honourable, but we <FI>are<Fi> despised.","Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;","And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:","Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, <FI>and are<Fi> the offscouring of all things unto this day.<CM>","I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <FI>you<Fi>.","For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <FI>have ye<Fi> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.","Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.<CM>","For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.","Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.","But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.","For the kingdom of God <FI>is<Fi> not in word, but in power.","What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and <FI>in<Fi> the spirit of meekness?<CM>"]
