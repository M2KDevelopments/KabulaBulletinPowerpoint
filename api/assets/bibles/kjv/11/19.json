["And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.","Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do <FI>to me<Fi>, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.","And when he saw <FI>that<Fi>, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which <FI>belongeth<Fi> to Judah, and left his servant there.","But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I <FI>am<Fi> not better than my fathers.<RF>for himself: Heb. for his life<Rf>","And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise <FI>and<Fi> eat.","And he looked, and, behold, <FI>there was<Fi> a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.<RF>head: Heb. bolster<Rf>","And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise <FI>and<Fi> eat; because the journey <FI>is<Fi> too great for thee.","And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.<CM>","And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD <FI>came<Fi> to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?","And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, <FI>even<Fi> I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.","And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.
