["Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.","For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.","For I was my father's son, tender and only <FI>beloved<Fi> in the sight of my mother.","He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.","Get wisdom, get understanding: forget <FI>it<Fi> not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.","Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.","Wisdom <FI>is<Fi> the principal thing; <FI>therefore<Fi> get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.","Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.","She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.<RF>a crown…: or, she shall compass thee with a crown of glory<Rf>","Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.","I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.","When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.","Take fast hold of instruction; let <FI>her<Fi> not go: keep her; for she <FI>is<Fi> thy life.<CM>","Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil <FI>men<Fi>.","Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.","For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause <FI>some<Fi> to fall.","For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.","But the path of the just <FI>is<Fi> as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.","The way of the wicked <FI>is<Fi> as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.<CM>","My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.","Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.","For they <FI>are<Fi> life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.<RF>health: Heb. medicine<Rf>","Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it <FI>are<Fi> the issues of life.<RF>with…: Heb. above all keeping<Rf>","Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.<RF>a froward…: Heb. frowardness of mouth and perverseness of lips<Rf>","Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.","Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.<RF>let…: or, all thy ways shall be ordered aright<Rf>","Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.<CM>"]
