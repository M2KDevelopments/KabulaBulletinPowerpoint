["Sing, O barren, thou <FI>that<Fi> didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou <FI>that<Fi> didst not travail with child: for more <FI>are<Fi> the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.","Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;","For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.","Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.","For thy Maker <FI>is<Fi> thine husband; the LORD of hosts <FI>is<Fi> his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.<CM>","For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.","For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.","In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.","For this <FI>is as<Fi> the waters of Noah unto me: for <FI>as<Fi> I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.","For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.<CM>","O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, <FI>and<Fi> not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.","And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.","And all thy children <FI>shall be<Fi> taught of the LORD; and great <FI>shall be<Fi> the peace of thy children.","In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.","Behold, they shall surely gather together, <FI>but<Fi> not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.","Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.","No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue <FI>that<Fi> shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This <FI>is<Fi> the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness <FI>is<Fi> of me, saith the LORD.<CM>"]
