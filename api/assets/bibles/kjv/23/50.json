["Thus saith the LORD, Where <FI>is<Fi> the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors <FI>is it<Fi> to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.","Wherefore, when I came, <FI>was there<Fi> no man? when I called, <FI>was there<Fi> none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because <FI>there is<Fi> no water, and dieth for thirst.","I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.<CM>","The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to <FI>him that is<Fi> weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.","The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.","I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.","For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.","<FI>He is<Fi> near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who <FI>is<Fi> mine adversary? let him come near to me.<RF>mineâ€¦: Heb. the master of my cause?<Rf>","Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who <FI>is<Fi> he <FI>that<Fi> shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.<CM>","Who <FI>is<Fi> among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh <FI>in<Fi> darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.","Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass <FI>yourselves<Fi> about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks <FI>that<Fi> ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.<CM>"]
