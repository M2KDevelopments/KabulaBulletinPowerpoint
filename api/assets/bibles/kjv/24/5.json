["Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be <FI>any<Fi> that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.","And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.","O LORD, <FI>are<Fi> not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, <FI>but<Fi> they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.","Therefore I said, Surely these <FI>are<Fi> poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, <FI>nor<Fi> the judgment of their God.","I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, <FI>and<Fi> the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, <FI>and<Fi> burst the bonds.","Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, <FI>and<Fi> a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, <FI>and<Fi> their backslidings are increased.<RF>evenings: or, deserts<Rf><RF>are increased: Heb. are strong<Rf>","How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by <FI>them that are<Fi> no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.","They were <FI>as<Fi> fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.","Shall I not visit for these <FI>things<Fi>? saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?<CM>","Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they <FI>are<Fi> not the LORD'S.","For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.","They have belied the LORD, and said, <FI>It is<Fi> not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:","And the prophets shall become wind, and the word <FI>is<Fi> not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.","Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.","Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it <FI>is<Fi> a mighty nation, it <FI>is<Fi> an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.","Their quiver <FI>is<Fi> as an open sepulchre, they <FI>are<Fi> all mighty men.","And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, <FI>which<Fi> thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.","Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.","And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these <FI>things<Fi> unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land <FI>that is<Fi> not yours.<CM>","Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,","Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:<RF>understanding: Heb. heart<Rf>","Fear ye not me?
