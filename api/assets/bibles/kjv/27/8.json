["In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, <FI>even unto<Fi> me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.","And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I <FI>was<Fi> at Shushan <FI>in<Fi> the palace, which <FI>is<Fi> in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.","Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had <FI>two<Fi> horns: and the <FI>two<Fi> horns <FI>were<Fi> high; but one <FI>was<Fi> higher than the other, and the higher came up last.<RF>the other: Heb. the second<Rf>","I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither <FI>was there any<Fi> that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.","And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat <FI>had<Fi> a notable horn between his eyes.<RF>touched…: or, none touched him in the earth<Rf><RF>a notable…: Heb. a horn of sight<Rf>","And he came to the ram that had <FI>two<Fi> horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.","And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.","Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.","And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant <FI>land<Fi>.","And it waxed great, <FI>even<Fi> to the host of heaven; and it cast down <FI>some<Fi> of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.<RF>to the host: or, against the host<Rf>","Yea, he magnified <FI>himself<Fi> even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily <FI>sacrifice<Fi> was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.<RF>to: or, against<Rf><RF>by him: or, from him<Rf>","And an host was given <FI>him<Fi> against the daily <FI>sacrifice<Fi> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.<RF>an host…: or, the host was given over for the transgression against the daily sacrifice<Rf>","Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain <FI>saint<Fi> which spake, How long <FI>shall be<Fi> the vision <FI>concerning<Fi> the daily <FI>sacrifice<Fi>, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?<RF>that…: or, the numberer of secrets, or, the wonderful numberer: Heb. Palmoni<Rf><RF>of…: or, making desolate<Rf>","And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.<RF>days: Heb. evening morning<Rf><RF>cleansed: Heb. justified<Rf><CM>","And it came to pass, when I, <FI>even<Fi> I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.","And I heard a man's voice between <FI>the banks of<Fi> Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this <FI>man<Fi> to understand the vision.","So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end <FI>shall be<Fi> the vision.","Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.<RF>set…: Heb. made me stand upon my standing<Rf>","And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end <FI>shall be<Fi>.","The ram which thou sawest having <FI>two<Fi> horns <FI>are<Fi> the kings of Media and Persia.","And the rough goat <FI>is<Fi> the king of Grecia: and the great horn that <FI>is<Fi> between his eyes <FI>is<Fi> the first king.","Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.","And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.<RF>are…: Heb. are accomplished<Rf>","And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.<RF>holy…: Heb. people of the holy ones<Rf>","And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify <FI>himself<Fi> in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.<RF>peace: or, prosperity<Rf>","And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told <FI>is<Fi> true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it <FI>shall be<Fi> for many days.","And I Daniel fainted, and was sick <FI>certain<Fi> days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood <FI>it<Fi>.<CM>"]
