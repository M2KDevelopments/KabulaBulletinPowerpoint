["A Song of degrees. I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.<RF>I willâ€¦: or, Shall I lift up mine eyes to the hills? whence should my help come?<Rf>","My help <FI>cometh<Fi> from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.","He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.","Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.","The LORD <FI>is<Fi> thy keeper: the LORD <FI>is<Fi> thy shade upon thy right hand.","The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.","The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.","The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.<CM>"]
