["To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, <FI>A Psalm<Fi> of David. Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto <FI>my<Fi> soul.","I sink in deep mire, where <FI>there is<Fi> no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.<RF>deep mire: Heb. the mire of depth<Rf><RF>deep waters: Heb. depth of waters<Rf>","I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.","They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, <FI>being<Fi> mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored <FI>that<Fi> which I took not away.","O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.<RF>sins: Heb. guiltiness<Rf>","Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.","Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.","I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.","For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.","When I wept, <FI>and chastened<Fi> my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.","I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.","They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I <FI>was<Fi> the song of the drunkards.<RF>drunkards: Heb. drinkers of strong drink<Rf><CM>","But as for me, my prayer <FI>is<Fi> unto thee, O LORD, <FI>in<Fi> an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.","Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.","Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.","Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness <FI>is<Fi> good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.","And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.<RF>hear…: Heb. make haste to hear me<Rf>","Draw nigh unto my soul, <FI>and<Fi> redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.","Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries <FI>are<Fi> all before thee.","Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked <FI>for some<Fi> to take pity, but <FI>there was<Fi> none; and for comforters, but I found none.<RF>to take…: Heb. to lament with me<Rf>","They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.<CM>","Let their table become a snare before them: and <FI>that which should have been<Fi> for <FI>their<Fi> welfare, <FI>let it become<Fi> a trap.","Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.","Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.","Let their habitation be desolate; <FI>and<Fi> let none dwell in their tents.<RF>their habitation: Heb. their palace<Rf><RF>let none…: Heb. let there not be a dweller<Rf>","For they persecute <FI>him<Fi> whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.<RF>those…: Heb. thy wounded<Rf>","Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.<RF>iniquity unto…: or, punishment of iniquity, etc<Rf>","Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.","But I <FI>am<Fi> poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.<CM>","I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.","<FI>This<Fi> also shall please the LORD better than an ox <FI>or<Fi> bullock that hath horns and hoofs.","The humble shall see <FI>this, and<Fi> be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.<RF>humble: or, meek<Rf>","For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.","Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.<RF>moveth: Heb. creepeth<Rf>","For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.","The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.<CM>"]
