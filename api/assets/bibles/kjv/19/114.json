["When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;","Judah was his sanctuary, <FI>and<Fi> Israel his dominion.","The sea saw <FI>it<Fi>, and fled: Jordan was driven back.","The mountains skipped like rams, <FI>and<Fi> the little hills like lambs.","What <FI>ailed<Fi> thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, <FI>that<Fi> thou wast driven back?","Ye mountains, <FI>that<Fi> ye skipped like rams; <FI>and<Fi> ye little hills, like lambs?","Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;","Which turned the rock <FI>into<Fi> a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.<CM>"]
