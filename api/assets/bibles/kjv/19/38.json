["A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.","For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.","<FI>There is<Fi> no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither <FI>is there any<Fi> rest in my bones because of my sin.<RF>rest: Heb. peace, or, health<Rf>","For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.","My wounds stink <FI>and<Fi> are corrupt because of my foolishness.","I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.<RF>troubled: Heb. wried<Rf>","For my loins are filled with a loathsome <FI>disease<Fi>: and <FI>there is<Fi> no soundness in my flesh.","I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.","Lord, all my desire <FI>is<Fi> before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.","My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.<RF>is gone…: Heb. is not with me<Rf>","My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.<RF>sore: Heb. stroke<Rf><RF>my kinsmen: or, my neighbours<Rf><CM>","They also that seek after my life lay snares <FI>for me<Fi>: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.","But I, as a deaf <FI>man<Fi>, heard not; and <FI>I was<Fi> as a dumb man <FI>that<Fi> openeth not his mouth.","Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth <FI>are<Fi> no reproofs.","For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.<RF>in…: or, thee do I wait for<Rf><RF>hear: or, answer<Rf>","For I said, <FI>Hear me<Fi>, lest <FI>otherwise<Fi> they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify <FI>themselves<Fi> against me.","For I <FI>am<Fi> ready to halt, and my sorrow <FI>is<Fi> continually before me.<RF>to halt: Heb. for halting<Rf>","For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.","But mine enemies <FI>are<Fi> lively, <FI>and<Fi> they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.<RF>are lively…: Heb. being living, are strong<Rf>","They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow <FI>the thing that<Fi> good <FI>is<Fi>.","Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.","Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.<RF>to…: Heb. for my help<Rf><CM>"]
