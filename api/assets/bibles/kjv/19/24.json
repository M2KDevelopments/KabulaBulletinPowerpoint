["A Psalm of David. The earth <FI>is<Fi> the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.","For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.<CM>","Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?","He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.<RF>Heâ€¦: Heb. The clean of hands<Rf>","He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.","This <FI>is<Fi> the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.<RF>O Jacob: or, O God of Jacob<Rf><CM>","Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.","Who <FI>is<Fi> this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.","Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift <FI>them<Fi> up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.","Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he <FI>is<Fi> the King of glory. Selah.<CM>"]
