["A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, <FI>and<Fi> in thy righteousness.","And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.","For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.","Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.","I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.","I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul <FI>thirsteth<Fi> after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.<CM>","Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.<RF>lest…: or, for I am become like, etc<Rf>","Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.","Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.<RF>flee…: Heb. hide me with thee<Rf>","Teach me to do thy will; for thou <FI>art<Fi> my God: thy spirit <FI>is<Fi> good; lead me into the land of uprightness.","Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.","And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I <FI>am<Fi> thy servant.<CM>"]
