["To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him <FI>cometh<Fi> my salvation.<RF>Truly: or, Only<Rf><RF>waiteth: Heb. is silent<Rf>","He only <FI>is<Fi> my rock and my salvation; <FI>he is<Fi> my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.<RF>defence: Heb. high place<Rf>","How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall <FI>shall ye be, and as<Fi> a tottering fence.","They only consult to cast <FI>him<Fi> down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.<RF>inwardly: Heb. in their inward parts<Rf>","My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation <FI>is<Fi> from him.","He only <FI>is<Fi> my rock and my salvation: <FI>he is<Fi> my defence; I shall not be moved.","In God <FI>is<Fi> my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, <FI>and<Fi> my refuge, <FI>is<Fi> in God.<CM>","Trust in him at all times; <FI>ye<Fi> people, pour out your heart before him: God <FI>is<Fi> a refuge for us.
