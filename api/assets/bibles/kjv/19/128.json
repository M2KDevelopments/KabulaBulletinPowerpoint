["A Song of degrees. Blessed <FI>is<Fi> every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.","For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy <FI>shalt<Fi> thou <FI>be<Fi>, and <FI>it shall be<Fi> well with thee.","Thy wife <FI>shall be<Fi> as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.","Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.","The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.","Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, <FI>and<Fi> peace upon Israel.<CM>"]
