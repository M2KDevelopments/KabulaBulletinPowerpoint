Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God <FI>endureth<Fi> continually.","Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.","Thou lovest evil more than good; <FI>and<Fi> lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.","Thou lovest all devouring words, O <FI>thou<Fi> deceitful tongue.<RF>O thou…: or, and the deceitful tongue<Rf>","God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of <FI>thy<Fi> dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.<RF>destroy…: Heb. beat thee down<Rf><CM>","The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:","Lo, <FI>this is<Fi> the man <FI>that<Fi> made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, <FI>and<Fi> strengthened himself in his wickedness.<RF>wickedness: or, substance<Rf>","But I <FI>am<Fi> like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.","I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done <FI>it<Fi>: and I will wait on thy name; for <FI>it is<Fi> good before thy saints.<CM>"]
