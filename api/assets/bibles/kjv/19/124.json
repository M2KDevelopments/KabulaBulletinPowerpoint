["A Song of degrees of David. If <FI>it had not been<Fi> the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;","If <FI>it had not been<Fi> the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:","Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:","Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:","Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.<CM>","Blessed <FI>be<Fi> the LORD, who hath not given us <FI>as<Fi> a prey to their teeth.","Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.","Our help <FI>is<Fi> in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.<CM>"]
