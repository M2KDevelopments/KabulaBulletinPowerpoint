["To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, <FI>A Psalm<Fi> of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.","Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.","For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.<CM>","Behold, God <FI>is<Fi> mine helper: the Lord <FI>is<Fi> with them that uphold my soul.","He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.<RF>mineâ€¦: Heb. those that observe me<Rf>","I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for <FI>it is<Fi> good.","For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen <FI>his desire<Fi> upon mine enemies.<CM>"]
