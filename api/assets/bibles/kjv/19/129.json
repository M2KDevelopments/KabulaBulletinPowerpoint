["A Song of degrees. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:<RF>Many…: or, Much<Rf>","Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.<RF>Many…: or, Much<Rf>","The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.","The LORD <FI>is<Fi> righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.<CM>","Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.","Let them be as the grass <FI>upon<Fi> the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:","Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.","Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD <FI>be<Fi> upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.<CM>"]
