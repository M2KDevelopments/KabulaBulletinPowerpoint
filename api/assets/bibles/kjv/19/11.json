["To the chief Musician, <FI>A Psalm<Fi> of David. In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee <FI>as<Fi> a bird to your mountain?","For, lo, the wicked bend <FI>their<Fi> bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.<RF>privily: Heb. in darkness<Rf>","If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?<CM>","The LORD <FI>is<Fi> in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne <FI>is<Fi> in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.","The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.","Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: <FI>this shall be<Fi> the portion of their cup.<RF>an horribleâ€¦: or, a burning tempest<Rf>","For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.<CM>"]
