["<FI>A Psalm<Fi> of David. I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.","I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.","In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, <FI>and<Fi> strengthenedst me <FI>with<Fi> strength in my soul.","All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.","Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great <FI>is<Fi> the glory of the LORD.<CM>","Though the LORD <FI>be<Fi> high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.","Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.","The LORD will perfect <FI>that which<Fi> concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, <FI>endureth<Fi> for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.<CM>"]
