["A Song of degrees. Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.","Behold, as the eyes of servants <FI>look<Fi> unto the hand of their masters, <FI>and<Fi> as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes <FI>wait<Fi> upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.","Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.","Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, <FI>and<Fi> with the contempt of the proud.<CM>"]
