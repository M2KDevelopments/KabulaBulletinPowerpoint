["A Psalm of David. The LORD <FI>is<Fi> my shepherd; I shall not want.","He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.<RF>green…: Heb. pastures of tender grass<Rf><RF>still…: Heb. waters of quietness<Rf>","He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.","Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou <FI>art<Fi> with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.","Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.<RF>anointest: Heb. makest fat<Rf>","Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.<RF>for ever: Heb. to length of days<Rf><CM>"]
