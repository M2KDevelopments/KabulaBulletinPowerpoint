Selah.","Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.","I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.","I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.","Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?","Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth <FI>his<Fi> promise fail for evermore?<RF>for evermore: Heb. to generation and generation?<Rf>","Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?
