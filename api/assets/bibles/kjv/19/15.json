LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?<RF>abide: Heb. sojourn<Rf>","He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.","<FI>He that<Fi> backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.<RF>takethâ€¦: or, receiveth, or, endureth<Rf>","In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. <FI>He that<Fi> sweareth to <FI>his own<Fi> hurt, and changeth not.","<FI>He that<Fi> putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these <FI>things<Fi> shall never be moved.<CM>"]
