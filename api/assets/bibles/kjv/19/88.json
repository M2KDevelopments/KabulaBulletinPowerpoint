O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day <FI>and<Fi> night before thee:<RF>for the sons: or, of the sons<Rf><RF>Maschilâ€¦: or, A Psalm of Heman the Ezrahite, giving instruction<Rf>","Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;","For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.","I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man <FI>that hath<Fi> no strength:","Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.<RF>from: or, by<Rf>","Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.","Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted <FI>me<Fi> with all thy waves. Selah.","Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: <FI>I am<Fi> shut up, and I cannot come forth.","Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.<CM>","Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise <FI>and<Fi> praise thee? Selah.","Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? <FI>or<Fi> thy faithfulness in destruction?","Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?","But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.","LORD, why castest thou off my soul? <FI>why<Fi> hidest thou thy face from me?","I <FI>am<Fi> afflicted and ready to die from <FI>my<Fi> youth up: <FI>while<Fi> I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.","Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.","They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.<RF>daily: or, all the day<Rf>","Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, <FI>and<Fi> mine acquaintance into darkness.<CM>"]
