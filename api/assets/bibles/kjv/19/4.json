["To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me <FI>when I was<Fi> in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.<RF>chief…: or, overseer<Rf><RF>have…: or, be gracious unto me<Rf>","O ye sons of men, how long <FI>will ye turn<Fi> my glory into shame? <FI>how long<Fi> will ye love vanity, <FI>and<Fi> seek after leasing? Selah.","But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.","Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.","Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.<CM>","<FI>There be<Fi> many that say, Who will shew us <FI>any<Fi> good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.","Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time <FI>that<Fi> their corn and their wine increased.","I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.<CM>"]
