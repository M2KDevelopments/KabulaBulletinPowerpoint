And his mother said, Blessed <FI>be thou<Fi> of the LORD, my son.","And when he had restored the eleven hundred <FI>shekels<Fi> of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.","Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred <FI>shekels<Fi> of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.","And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.<RF>consecrated: Heb. filled the hand<Rf>","In those days <FI>there was<Fi> no king in Israel, <FI>but<Fi> every man did <FI>that which was<Fi> right in his own eyes.<CM>","And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who <FI>was<Fi> a Levite, and he sojourned there.","And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find <FI>a place<Fi>: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.<RF>as he…: Heb. in making his way<Rf>","And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou?
