["And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,","Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, <FI>or than<Fi> a branch which is among the trees of the forest?","Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will <FI>men<Fi> take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?","Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for <FI>any<Fi> work?<RF>Is it…: Heb. Will it prosper?<Rf>","Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for <FI>any<Fi> work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?<RF>meet: Heb. made fit<Rf>","Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from <FI>one<Fi> fire, and <FI>another<Fi> fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I <FI>am<Fi> the LORD, when I set my face against them.","And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.<RF>committed…: Heb. trespassed a trespass<Rf><CM>"]
