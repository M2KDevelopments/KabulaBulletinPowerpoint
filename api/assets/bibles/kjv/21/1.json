["The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.","Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all <FI>is<Fi> vanity.","What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?<CM>","<FI>One<Fi> generation passeth away, and <FI>another<Fi> generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.","The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.<RF>hasteth: Heb. panteth<Rf>","The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.","All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea <FI>is<Fi> not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.<RF>return…: Heb. return to go<Rf>","All things <FI>are<Fi> full of labour; man cannot utter <FI>it<Fi>: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.<CM>","The thing that hath been, it <FI>is that<Fi> which shall be; and that which is done <FI>is<Fi> that which shall be done: and <FI>there is<Fi> no new <FI>thing<Fi> under the sun.","Is there <FI>any<Fi> thing whereof it may be said, See, this <FI>is<Fi> new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.","<FI>There is<Fi> no remembrance of former <FI>things<Fi>; neither shall there be <FI>any<Fi> remembrance of <FI>things<Fi> that are to come with <FI>those<Fi> that shall come after.<CM>","I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.","And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all <FI>things<Fi> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.<RF>to be…: or, to afflict them<Rf>","I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all <FI>is<Fi> vanity and vexation of spirit.","<FI>That which is<Fi> crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.<RF>that which is wanting: Heb. defect<Rf>","I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all <FI>they<Fi> that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.<RF>had…: Heb. had seen much<Rf>","And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.","For in much wisdom <FI>is<Fi> much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.<CM>"]
