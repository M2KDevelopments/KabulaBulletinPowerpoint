["Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.<RF>uponâ€¦: Heb. upon the face of the waters<Rf>","Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.","If the clouds be full of rain, they empty <FI>themselves<Fi> upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.","He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.","As thou knowest not what <FI>is<Fi> the way of the spirit, <FI>nor<Fi> how the bones <FI>do grow<Fi> in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.","In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both <FI>shall be<Fi> alike good.<RF>shall prosper: Heb. shall be right<Rf><CM>","Truly the light <FI>is<Fi> sweet, and a pleasant <FI>thing it is<Fi> for the eyes to behold the sun:","But if a man live many years, <FI>and<Fi> rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh <FI>is<Fi> vanity.","Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these <FI>things<Fi> God will bring thee into judgment.","Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth <FI>are<Fi> vanity.<RF>sorrow: or, anger<Rf><CM>"]
