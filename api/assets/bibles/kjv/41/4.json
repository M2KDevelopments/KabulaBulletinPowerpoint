["And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.","And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,","<FR>Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:<Fr>","<FR>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.<Fr>","<FR>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:<Fr>","<FR>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.<Fr>","<FR>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.<Fr>","<FR>And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.<Fr>","And he said unto them, <FR>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<Fr>","And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.","And he said unto them, <FR>Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all <FI>these<Fi> things are done in parables:<Fr>","<FR><FO>That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and <FI>their<Fi> sins should be forgiven them.<Fo><Fr>","And he said unto them, <FR>Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?<Fr>","<FR>The sower soweth the word.<Fr>","<FR>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.<Fr>","<FR>And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;<Fr>","<FR>And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.<Fr><RF>offended: or, stumbled, or, caused to fall into sin<Rf>","<FR>And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,<Fr>","<FR>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.<Fr><RF>lusts: or, inordinate desires<Rf>","<FR>And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive <FI>it<Fi>, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.<Fr><CM>","And he said unto them, <FR>Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?<Fr><RF>bushel: the word in the original signifieth a less measure<Rf>","<FR>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.<Fr>","<FR>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.<Fr>","And he said unto them, <FR>Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.<Fr>","<FR>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.<Fr>","And he said, <FR>So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;<Fr>","<FR>And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.<Fr>","<FR>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.<Fr>","<FR>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.<Fr><RF>broughtâ€¦: or, ripe<Rf>","And he said, <FR>Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?<Fr>","<FR><FI>It is<Fi> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:<Fr>","<FR>But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.<Fr>","And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear <FI>it<Fi>.","But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.<CM>","And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, <FR>Let us pass over unto the other side.<Fr>","And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.","And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.","And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?","And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, <FR>Peace, be still.<Fr> And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.","And he said unto them, <FR>Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?<Fr>","And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?<CM>"]
