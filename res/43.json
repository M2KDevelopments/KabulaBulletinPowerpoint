When Morning Gilds the Skies","verses":["When morning gilds the skies,\nMy heart awaking cries,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nAlike at work and prayer,\nTo Jesus I repair;\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!","Whene'er the sweet church bell\nPeals over hill and dell,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nO hark to what it sings,\nAs joyously it rings,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!","The night becomes as day,\nWhen from the heart we say,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nThe pow'rs of darkness fear,\nWhen this sweet song they hear,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!","Ye nations of mankind,\nIn this your concord find,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nLet all the earth around\nRing joyous with the sound,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!","In heaven's eternal bliss\nThe loveliest strain is this,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nLet earth, and sea, and sky\nFrom depth to height reply,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!","Be this, while life is mine,\nMy canticle divine,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!\nBe this th'eternal song\nThrough all the ages long,\nMay Jesus Christ be praised!"],"chorus":""}
