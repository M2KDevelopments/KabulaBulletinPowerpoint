{"title":"    749. A Song of Triumph - Revelation 7  ","number":749,"verses":["\n      I looked and there before me was a\ngreat multitude that no one could count,\nfrom every nation, tribe, people and language,\nstanding before the throne and in front of the Lamb.\nThey were wearing white robes\nand were holding palm branches in their hands.\n    ","\n      And they cried out in a loud voice:\n\"Salvation belongs to our God,\nwho sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.\"\n    ","\n      All the angels were standing around the throne\nand around the elders and the four living creatures.\nThey fell down on their faces before the throne\nand worshiped God, saying:\n    ","\n      \"Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and\r\nthanks and honor and power and strength\nbe to our God for ever and ever. Amen!\"\n    ","\n      Then one of the elders asked me,\n\"These in white robes who are they,\nand where did they come from?\"\nI answered, \"Sir, you know.\"\nAnd he said, \"These are they who\nhave come out of the great tribulation;\nthey have washed their robes and made them white\nin the blood of the Lamb. Therefore,\n    ","\n      \"they are before the throne of God\nand serve him day and night in his temple;\nand he who sits on the throne\nwill spread his tent over them.\n    ","\n      \"Never again will they hunger;\nnever again will they thirst.\nThe sun will not beat upon them,\nnor any scorching heat.\n    ","\n      \"For the Lamb at the center of\nthe throne will be their shepherd;\nhe will lead them to springs of\tliving water.\nAnd God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.\"\n    "]}
