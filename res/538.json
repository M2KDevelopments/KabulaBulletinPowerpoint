{"number":538,"title":"538. Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah","verses":["Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,\nPilgrim through this barren land;\nI am weak, but Thou art mighty;\nHold me with Thy powerful hand;\nBread of heaven, Bread of heaven,\nFeed me till I want no more,\nFeed me till I want no more.","Open now the crystal fountain,\nWhence the healing stream doth flow;\nLet the fire and cloudy pillar\nLead me all my journey through;\nStrong deliverer, strong deliverer.\nBe Thou still my strength and shield,\nBe Thou still my strength and shield.","When I tread the verge of Jordan,\nBid my anxious fears subside;\nDeath of death and hell's destruction,\nLand me safe on Canaan's side;\nSongs of praises, songs of praises\nI will ever give to Thee,\nI will ever give to Thee."],"chorus":""}
