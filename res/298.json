{"number":298,"title":"298. I Lay My Sins On Jesus","verses":["I lay my sins on Jesus,\nThe spotless Lamb of God;\nHe bears them all, and frees us\nFrom the accursed load,\nFrom the accursed load.","I bring my guilt to Jesus,\nTo wash my crimson stains\nWhite in His blood most precious,\nTill not a stain remains,\nTill not a stain remains.","I lay my wants on Jesus,\r\nAll fullness dwells in Him;\nHe healeth my diseases,\nHe doth my soul redeem,\nHe doth my soul redeem.","I long to be like Jesus,\nMeek loving, lowly, mild;\nI long to be like Jesus,\nThe Father's holy child,\nThe Father's holy child.","I long to be with Jesus\nAmid the heav'nly throng,\nTo sing with them His praises,\nAnd learn the angels' song,\nAnd learn the angels' song."],"chorus":""}
