Let All On Earth Their Voices Raise","verses":["Let all on earth their voices raise,\nTo sing the great Jehovah's praise,\nAnd bless His holy name:\nHis glory let the people know,\nHis wonders to the nations show,\nHis saving grace proclaim.","He framed the globe; He built the sky;\nHe made the shining worlds on high,\nAnd reigns in glory there:\nHis beams are majesty and light;\nHis beauties, how divinely bright!\nHis dwelling place, how fair!","Come, the great day, the glorious hour,\nWhen earth shall feel His saving power,\nAll nations fear His name;\nThen shall the race of men confess\nThe beauty of His holiness,\r\nHis saving grace proclaim."],"chorus":""}
