{"number":556,"title":"556. As Saints of Old","verses":["As saints of old their first-fruits brought\nOf orchard, flock, and field\nTo God, the giver of all good,\nThe source of bounteous yield;\nSo we today first-fruits would bring,\nThe wealth of this good land,\nOf farm and market, shop and home,\nOf mind and heart and hand.","A world in need now summons us\nTo labor, love, and give;\nTo make our life an offering\nTo God, that all may live,\nThe church of Christ is calling us\nTo make the dream come true:\nA world redeemed by Christ-like love;\nAll life in Christ made new.","In gratitude and humble trust\nWe bring our best today\nTo serve Your cause and share Your love\nWith all along life's way.\nO God, who gave Yourself to us\nIn Jesus Christ Your Son,\nTeach us to give ourselves each day\nUntil life's work is done."],"chorus":""}
