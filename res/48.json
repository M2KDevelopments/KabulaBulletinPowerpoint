Softly Now the Light of Day","verses":["Softly now the light of day\nFades upon our sight away;\nFree from care, from labor free,\nLord, we would commune with Thee.","Thou, whose all-pervading eye\nNought escapes, without, within,\nPardon each infirmity,\nOpen fault, and secret sin.","Soon from us the light of day\nShall forever pass away;\nThen, from sin and sorrow free,\nTake us, Lord, to dwell with Thee."],"chorus":""}
