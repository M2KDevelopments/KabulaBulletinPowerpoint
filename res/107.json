{"number":107,"title":"107. God Moves in a Mysterious Way","verses":["God moves in a mysterious way\nHis wonders to perform;\nHe plants His footsteps in the sea,\nAnd rides upon the storm.","Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;\nThe clouds ye so much dread\nAre big with mercy, and shall break\nIn blessings on your head.","Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,\nBut trust Him for His grace;\nBehind a frowning providence\nHe hides a smiling face.","His purposes will ripen fast,\nUnfolding every hour;\nThe bud may have a bitter taste,\nBut sweet will be the flower.","Blind unbelief is sure to err,\nAnd scan His work in vain;\nGod is His own interpreter,\nAnd He will make it plain."],"chorus":""}
