        "The Lord in Zion reigneth,\nLet all the world rejoice,\nAnd come before His throne of grace\nWith tuneful heart and voice;\nThe Lord in Zion reigneth,\nAnd there His praise shall ring,\nTo Him shall princes bend the knee\nAnd kings their glory bring.",
        "The Lord in Zion reigneth,\nAnd who so great as He?\nThe depths of earth are in His hands;\nHe rules the mighty sea,\nO crown His name with honor,\nAnd let His standard wave,\nTill distant isles beyond the deep\nShall own His power to save.",
        "The Lord in Zion reigneth,\nThese hours to Him belong;\nO enter now His temple gates,\nAnd fill His courts with song;\nBeneath His royal banner\nLet every creature fall,\nExalt the King of heaven and earth,\nAnd crown Him Lord of all."
