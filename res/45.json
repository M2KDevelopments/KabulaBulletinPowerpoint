Open Now Thy Gates of Beauty","verses":["Open now Thy gates of beauty,\nZion, let me enter there,\nWhere my soul in joyful duty\nWaits for God who answers prayer.\nOh, how blessed is this place,\nFilled with solace, light, and grace!","Gracious God, I come before Thee;\nCome Thou also unto me;\nWhere we find Thee and adore Thee,\nThere a heav'n on earth must be.\nTo my heart, oh, enter Thou,\nLet it be Thy temple now!","Here Thy praise is gladly chanted,\nHere Thy seed is duly sown;\nLet my soul, where it is planted,\nBring forth precious sheaves alone.\nSo that all I hear may be\nFruitful unto life in me.","Thou my faith increase and quicken,\nLet me keep Thy gift divine;\nHowsoe'er temptations thicken,\nMay Thy Word still o'er me shine\nAs my guiding star through life,\nAs my comfort in all strife.","Speak, O God, and I will hear Thee,\nLet Thy will be done indeed;\nMay I, undisturbed, draw near Thee\nWhile Thou dost Thy people feed\nHere of life the fountain flows;\nHere is balm for all our woes."],"chorus":""}
