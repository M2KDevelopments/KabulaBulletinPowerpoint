{"number":267,"title":"267. Spirit Divine","verses":["Spirit divine, attend our prayers,\nAnd make this house Thy home;\nDescend with all Thy gracious powers,\nO come, great Spirit, come!","Come as the light; to us reveal\nOur emptiness and woe,\nAnd lead us in those paths of life\nWhereon the righteous go.","Come as the fire, and purge our hearts\nLike sacrificial flame;\nLet our whole soul an off'ring be\nTo our Redeemer's name.","Come as the dove, and spread Thy wings,\nThe wings of peaceful love;\nAnd let Thy church on earth become\nBlest as the church above.","Spirit divine, attend our prayers,\nMake a lost world Thy home;\nDescend with all Thy gracious powers,\nO come, great Spirit, come!"],"chorus":""}
