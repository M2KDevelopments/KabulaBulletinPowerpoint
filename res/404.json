{"number":404,"title":"404. Now Let Us From This Table Rise","verses":["Now let us from this table rise\r\nRenewed in body, mind, and soul;\r\nWith Christ we die and live again,\r\nHis selfless love has made us whole.","With minds alert, upheld by grace,\r\nTo spread the word in speech and deed,\r\nWe follow in the steps of Christ,\r\nAt one with all in hope and need.","To fill each human house with love,\r\nIt is the sacrament of care;\r\nThe work that Christ began to do\r\nWe humbly pledge ourselves to share.","Then grant us courage, Father God,\r\nTo choose again the pilgrim way\r\nAnd help us to accept with joy\r\nThe challenge of tomorrow's day."],"chorus":""}
