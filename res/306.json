{"number":306,"title":"306. Draw Me Nearer","verses":["I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,\nAnd it told Thy love to me;\nBut I long to rise in the arms of faith,\nAnd be closer drawn to Thee.","Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,\nBy the power of grace divine;\nMay my soul look up with a steadfast hope\nAnd my will be lost in Thine.","O the pure delight of a single hour\nThat before Thy throne I spend,\nWhen I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,\nI commune as friend with friend!"],"chorus":"Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,\nTo the cross where Thou hast died;\nDraw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,\nTo Thy precious, bleeding side."}
