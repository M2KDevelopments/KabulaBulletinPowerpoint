{"number":226,"title":"226. Lift Up Your Heads","verses":["Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates!\nBehold the King of glory waits;\nThe King of kings is drawing near,\nThe Savior of the world is here.","The Lord is just, a helper tried;\nMercy is ever at His side;\nHis kingly crown is holiness,\nHis scepter, pity in distress.","O blest the land, the city blest,\nWhere Christ the Ruler is confessed!\nO happy hearts and happy homes\nTo whom this King in triumph comes!","Fling wide the portals of your heart;\nMake it a temple, set apart\nFrom earthly use for heaven's employ,\nAdorned with prayer, and love, and joy.","Redeemer, come; I open wide\nMy heart to Thee; here, Lord, abide.\nLet me Thy inner presence feel,\nThy grace and love in me reveal."],"chorus":""}
