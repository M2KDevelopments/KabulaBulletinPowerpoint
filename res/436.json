{"number":436,"title":"436. The Homeland","verses":["The homeland! O the homeland!\nThe land of the freeborn!\nThere's no night in the homeland,\nBut aye the fadeless morn;\nI'm sighing for the homeland,\nMy heart is aching here;\nThere is no pain in the homeland\nTo which I'm drawing near;\nThere is no pain in the homeland\nTo which I'm drawing near.","My Lord is in the homeland,\nWith angels bright and fair;\nThere's no sin in the homeland,\nAnd no temptation there;\nThe music of the homeland\nIs ringing in my ears;\nAnd when I think of the homeland\nMy eyes are filled with tears;\nAnd when I think of the homeland\nMy eyes are filled with tears.","The dwellers in the homeland\nAre beckoning me to come,\nWhere neither death nor sorrow\nInvades their holy home;\nO dear, dear native country!\nO rest and peace above!\nChrist bring us all to the homeland\nOf Thy redeeming love;\nChrist bring us all to the homeland\nOf Thy redeeming love."],"chorus":""}
