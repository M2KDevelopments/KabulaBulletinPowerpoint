{"number":139,"title":"139. While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks","verses":["While shepherds watched their flocks by night,\nAll seated on the ground,\nThe angel of the Lord came down,\nAnd glory shone around.","\"Fear not!\" said he for mighty dread\nHad seized their troubled mind;\n\"Glad tidings of great joy I bring,\nTo you and all mankind.","\"To you, in David's town this day,\nIs born of David's line,\nThe Savior who is Christ the Lord;\nAnd this shall be the sign:","\"The heavenly Babe you there shall find\nTo human view displayed,\nAll meanly wrapped in swathing bands,\nAnd in a manger laid.\"","Thus spake the seraph; and forthwith\nAppeared a shining throng\nOf angels praising God on high,\nWho thus addressed their song:","\"All glory be to God on high,\nAnd to the earth be peace;\nGood will henceforth from heaven to men,\nBegin and never cease!\""],"chorus":""}
