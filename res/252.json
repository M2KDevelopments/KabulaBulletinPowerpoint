Come, Let Us Sing","verses":["Come, let us sing the song of songs;\nThe angels first began the strain;\nThe homage which to Christ belongs:\n\"Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!\"","Slain to redeem us by His blood,\nTo cleanse from every sinful stain,\nAnd make us kings and priests to God:\n\"Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!\"","To Him who suffered on the tree,\nOur souls, at His soul's price, to gain,\nBlessing, and praise, and glory be:\n\"Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!\"","To Him, enthroned by filial right\nAll power in heaven and earth proclaim,\nHonor, and majesty, and might:\n\"Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!\"","Long as we live, and when we die,\nAnd while in heaven with Him we reign,\nThis song our song of songs shall be:\n\"Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!\""],"chorus":""}
