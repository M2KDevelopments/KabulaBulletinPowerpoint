The Resurrection of God's People - Romans 14, 1 Corinthians 15, 1 Thessalonians 4  ","number":781,"verses":["To this end Christ died and lived again,\nthat he might be Lord\nboth of the dead and of the living.\n    ","If for this life only\nwe have hoped in Christ,\nwe are of all men most to be pitied.\nBut in fact Christ has been raised\nfrom the dead, the first fruits of those\nwho have fallen asleep.\n    ","For as by a man came death,\nby a man has come also\nthe resurrection of the dead.\nFor as in Adam all die,\nso also in Christ shall all be made alive.\n    ","For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord,\nthat we who are alive,\nwho are left until the coming of the Lord,\nshall not precede those who have fallen asleep.\n    ","For the Lord himself will descend\nfrom heaven with a cry of command,\nwith the archangel's call,\nand with the sound of the trumpet of God.\nAnd the dead in Christ will rise first;\n    ","then we who are alive, who are left,\nshall be caught up together with them\nin the clouds to meet the Lord in the air;\nand so we shall always be with the Lord.\nTherefore comfort one another with these words.\n    ","Lo! I tell you a mystery.\nWe shall not all sleep,\nbut we shall all be changed,\nin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,\nat the last trumpet.\nFor the trumpet will sound,\nand the dead will be raised in perishable,\nand we shall be changed.\n    ","Thanks be to God,\nwho gives us the victory\nthrough our Lord Jesus Christ.\n    "]}
