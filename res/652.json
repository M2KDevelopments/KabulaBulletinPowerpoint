{"number":652,"title":"652. Love at Home","verses":["There is beauty all around,\nWhen there's love at home;\nThere is joy in every sound,\nWhen there's love at home.\nPeace and plenty here abide,\nSmiling fair on every side;\nTime doth softly, sweetly glide,\nWhen there's love at home.","Kindly heaven smiles above,\nWhen there's love at home;\nAll the earth is fill'd with love,\nWhen there's love at home.\nSweeter sings the brooklet by,\nBrighter beams the azure sky;\nO, there's One who smiles on high\nWhen there's love at home.","Jesus, make me wholly Thine,\nThen there's love at home;\nMay Thy sacrifice be mine,\nThen there's love at home.\nSafely from all harm I'll rest,\nWith no sinful care distress'd,\nThro' Thy tender mercy blessed,\nWhen there's love at home."],"chorus":"Love at home, love at home;\nTime doth softly, sweetly glide,\nWhen there's love at home."}
