{"number":456,"title":"456. My Lord and I","verses":["I have a Friend so precious,\nSo very dear to me,\nHe loves me with such tender love,\nHe loves so faithfully;\nI could not live apart from Him,\nI love to feel Him nigh,\nAnd so we dwell together,\nMy Lord and I.","Sometimes I'm faint and weary,\nHe knows that I am weak,\nAnd as He bids me lean on Him,\nHis help I gladly seek;\nHe leads me in the paths of light,\nBeneath a sunny sky,\nAnd so we walk together,\nMy Lord and I.","I tell Him all my sorrows,\nI tell Him all my joys,\nI tell Him all that pleases me,\nI tell Him what annoys;\nHe tells me what I ought to do,\nHe tells me how to try,\nAnd so we talk together,\nMy Lord and I.","He knows that I am longing\nSome weary soul to win,\nAnd so He bids me go and speak\nThe loving word for Him;\nHe bids me tell His wondrous love,\nAnd why He came to die,\nAnd so we work together,\nMy Lord and I."],"chorus":""}
