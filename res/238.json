{"number":238,"title":"238. How Sweet the Name!","verses":["How sweet the name of Jesus sounds\nIn a believer's ear!\nIt soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,\nAnd drives away his fear.","It makes the wounded spirit whole,\nAnd calms the troubled breast;\nTis manna to the hungry soul,\nAnd to the weary, rest.","Dear name, the rock on which I build,\nMy shield and hiding place,\nMy never-failing treasury, filled\nWith boundless stores of grace.","Jesus! my Shepherd, Guardian, Friend,\nMy Prophet, Priest, and King.\nMy Lord, my life, my way, my end!\nAccept the praise I bring.","Weak is the effort of my heart,\nAnd cold my warmest thought;\nBut when I see Thee as Thou art,\nI'll praise Thee as I ought."],"chorus":""}
