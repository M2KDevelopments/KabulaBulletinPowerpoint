{"number":12,"title":"12. Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee","verses":["Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,\nGod of glory, Lord of love;\nHearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee,\nHail Thee as the sun above.\nMelt the clouds of sin and sadness,\nDrive the dark of doubt away;\nGiver of immortal gladness,\nFill us with the light of day!","All Thy works with joy surround Thee,\nEarth and heav'n reflect Thy rays,\nStars and angels sing around Thee,\nCenter of unbroken praise;\nField and forest, vale and mountain,\nBloss'ming meadow, flashing sea,\nChanting bird and flowing fountain\nCall us to rejoice in Thee.","Thou art giving and forgiving,\nEver blessing, ever blest,\nWellspring of the joy of living,\nOcean-depth of happy rest!\nThou the Father, Christ our Brother;\nAll who live in love are Thine:\nTeach us how to love each other,\nLift us to the joy divine."],"chorus":""}
