{"number":413,"title":"413. God Has Spoken By His Prophets","verses":["God has spoken by His prophets,\r\nSpoken His unchanging Word,\r\nEach from age to age proclaiming\nGod, the one, the righteous Lord.\r\nMid the world's despair and turmoil,\r\nOne firm anchor holding fast;\r\nGod is King, His throne eternal,\r\nGod the first, and God the last.","God has spoken by Christ Jesus,\r\nChrist, the everlasting Son,\r\nBrightness of the Father's glory,\nWith the Father ever one;\r\nSpoken by the Word incarnate,\r\nGod of God, ere time began,\r\nLight of light, to earth descending,\r\nMan, revealing God to man.","God yet speaks by His own Spirit\r\nSpeaking to the hearts of men,\r\nIn the age-long Word expounding\r\nGod's own message, now as then;\r\nThrough the rise and fall of nations\nOne sure faith yet standing fast,\r\nGod is King, His Word unchanging,\r\nGod the first, and God the last."],"chorus":""}
