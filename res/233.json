{"number":233,"title":"233. Christ, Whose Glory Fills the Skies","verses":["Christ, whose glory fills the skies,\nChrist, the true, the only light,\nSun of Righteousness, a rise,\nTriumph o'er the shades of night;\nDay-spring from on high, be near;\nDay-star, in my heart appear.","Dark and cheerless is the morn\nUnaccompanied by Thee;\nJoyless is the day's return\nTill Thy mercy's beams I see;\nTill they inward light impart,\nCheer my eyes and warm my heart.","Visit, then, this soul of mine;\nPierce the gloom of sin and grief;\nFill me, Radiancy divine;\nScatter all my unbelief;\nMore and more Thyself display,\nShining to the perfect day."],"chorus":""}
