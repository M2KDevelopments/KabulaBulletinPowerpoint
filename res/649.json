Lord, While for All Mankind","verses":["Lord, while for all mankind we pray,\nOf every clime and coast,\nO hear us for our native land,\nThe land we love the most.","O guard our shores from every foe;\nWith peace our borders bless;\nWith prosperous times our cities crown,\nOur fields with plenteousness.","Unite us in the sacred love\nOf knowledge, truth, and Thee,\nAnd let our hills and valleys shout\nThe songs of liberty.","Lord of the nations, thus to Thee\nOur country we commend;\nBe Thou her refuge and her trust,\nHer everlasting friend."],"chorus":""}
