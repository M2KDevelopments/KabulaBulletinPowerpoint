Now That the Daylight Fills the Sky","verses":["Now that the daylight fills the sky,\nWe lift our hearts to God on high,\nThat He, in all we do or say,\nWould keep us free from harm today;","Would guard our hearts and tongues from strife;\nFrom anger's din would shield our life;\nFrom evil sights would turn our eyes,\nAnd close our ears to vanities;","So we, when this new day is gone\nAnd night in turn is drawing on,\nWith conscience by the world unstained\r\nShall praise His name for vict'ry gained.","\"All praise to You, creator Lord!\nAll praise to You, eternal Word!\nAll praise to You, O Spirit wise!\"\nWe sing as daylight fills the skies."],"chorus":""}
