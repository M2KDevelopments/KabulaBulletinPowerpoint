{"number":396,"title":"396. Lord God, Your Love Has Called Us Here","verses":["Lord God, Your love has called us here,\nAs we, by love, for love were made.\nYour living likeness still we bear\nTho' marred, dishonored, disobeyed.\nWe come, with all our heart and mind\nYour call to hear, Your love to find.","We come with self-inflicted pains\nOf broken trust and chosen wrong,\nHalf-free, half-bound by inner chains,\nBy social forces swept along,\nBy powers and systems close confined,\nYet seeking hope for humankind.","Lord God, in Christ You call our name,\nAnd then receive us as Your own,\nNot thro' some merit, right, or claim,\nBut by Your gracious love alone.\nWe strain to glimpse Your mercy-seat,\nAnd find You kneeling at our feet.","Then take the towel, and break the bread,\nAnd humble us, and call us friends.\nSuffer and serve till all are fed\nAnd show how grandly love intends\nTo work till all creation sings,\nTo fill all worlds, to crown all things.","Lord God, in Christ You set us free\nYour life to live, Your joy to share.\nGive us Your Spirit's liberty\nTo turn from guilt and dull despair\nAnd offer all that faith can do,\nWhile love is making all things new."],"chorus":""}
