Humility - Philippians 2  ","number":805,"verses":["If you have any encouragement\nfrom being united with Christ,\nif any comfort from his love,\nif any fellowship with the Spirit,\nif any tenderness and compassion,\n    ","then make my joy complete by being like-minded,\nhaving the same love,\nbeing one in spirit and purpose.\nDo nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit,\nbut in humility consider others better than yourselves.\n    ","Each of you should look not only to your own interests,\nbut also to the interests of others.\nYour attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:\nWho, being in very nature God,\n...made himself nothing.\n    ","And being found in appearance as a man,\nhe humbled himself and became obedient\nto death even death on a cross!\n    ","Therefore, my dear friends,...\ncontinue to work out your salvation\nwith fear and trembling,\nfor it is God who works in you to will\nand to act according to his good purpose.\n    ","Do everything without complaining or arguing,\nso that you may become blameless and pure,\nchildren of God without fault in\na crooked and depraved generation,\nin which you shine like stars in the universe.\n    "]}
