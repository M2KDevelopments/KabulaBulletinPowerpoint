Be Thou My Vision","verses":["Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;\nNaught be all else to me, Save that Thou art\nThou my best thought, by day or by night,\nWaking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.","Be Thou my wisdom, Be Thou my true word;\nI ever with Thee Thou with me, Lord;\nThou my great Father, I Thy true son;\nThou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.","Riches I heed not, Nor man's empty praise,\nThou mine inheritance, now and always:\nThou and Thou only, first in my heart,\nHigh King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.","High King of heaven, When vict'ry is won,\nMay I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!\nHeart of my own heart, whatever befall,\nStill be my vision, O ruler of all."],"chorus":""}
