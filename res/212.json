{"number":212,"title":"212. 'Tis Almost Time for the Lord to Come","verses":["'Tis almost time for the Lord to come,\nI hear the people say;\nThe stars of heaven are growing dim,\nIt must be the breaking of the day.","The signs foretold in the sun and moon,\nIn earth and sea and sky,\nAloud proclaim to all mankind,\nThe coming of the Master draweth nigh.","It must be time for the waiting church\nTo cast her pride away,\nWith girded loins and burning lamps,\nTo look for the breaking of the day.","Go quickly out in the streets and lanes\nAnd in the broad highway,\nAnd call the maimed, the halt, and blind,\nTo be ready for the breaking of the day."],"chorus":"O it must be the breaking of the day!\nO it must be the breaking of the day!\nThe night is almost gone,\nThe day is coming on;\nO it must be the breaking of the day!"}
