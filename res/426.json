I Shall See the King","verses":["I shall see the King Where the angels sing,\nI shall see the King some day,\nIn the better land, On the golden strand\nAnd with Him shall ever stay.","In the land of song, In the glory throng,\nWhere there never comes a night,\nWith my Lord once slain I shall ever reign\nIn the glory land of light.","I shall see the King, All my tributes bring,\nAnd shall look upon His face;\nThen my song shall be How He ransomed me\nAnd has kept me by His grace."],"chorus":"In His glory, I shall see the King,\nAnd forever endless praises sing;\n'Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;\nI shall see the King some day."}
