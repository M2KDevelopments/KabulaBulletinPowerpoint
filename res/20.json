O Praise Ye the Lord","verses":["O praise ye the Lord!\nPraise Him in the height;\nRejoice in His word,\nYe angels of light;\nYe heavens, adore Him\nBy whom ye were made,\nAnd worship before Him,\nIn brightness arrayed.","O praise ye the Lord!\nPraise Him upon earth,\nIn tuneful accord:\nYe sons of new birth;\nPraise Him who hath brought you\nHis grace from above,\nPraise Him who hath taught you\nTo sing of His love.","O praise ye the Lord,\nAll things that give sound;\nEach jubilant chord,\nRe-echo around;\nLoud organs His glory\nForth tell in deep tone,\nAnd sweet harp, the story\nOf what He hath done.","O praise ye the Lord!\nThanksgiving and song\nTo Him be outpoured\nAll ages along:\nFor love in creation,\nFor heaven restored.\nFor grace of salvation,\nO praise ye the Lord!"],"chorus":""}
