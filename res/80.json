{"number":80,"title":"80. O World of God","verses":["O world of God, so vast and strange,\r\nProfound and wonderful and fair,\nBeyond the utmost reach of thought,\nBut not beyond a Father's care!\nWe are not strangers on this earth\nWhirling amid the suns of space;\nWe are God's children, this our home,\nWith those of every clime and race.","O world of man where life is lived,\nSo strangely mingling joy and pain,\nSo full of evil and of good,\nSo needful that the good shall reign!\nIt is this world that God has loved,\nAnd goodness was its Maker's plan,\nThe promise of God's triumph is\r\nHis coming in a Son of Man.","O world of time's far-stretching years!\nThere was a day when time stood still,\nA central moment when there rose\r\nA cross upon a cruel hill;\nIn pain and death love's power was seen,\nThe mystery of time revealed,\nThe wisdom of the ways of God,\nThe grace through which man's hurt is healed."],"chorus":""}
