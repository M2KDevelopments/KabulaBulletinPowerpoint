{"number":631,"title":"631. When On Life A Darkness Falls","verses":["When on life a darkness falls,\nWhen the mist flows chilling,\nPaths and signposts lost in doubt,\nLoveless, unfulfilling,\nReach us, Jesus, from Your cross,\nThough we feel forsaken;\nKeep us through the aching night\nTill new dawns awaken.","When the dreams and vows of youth\nPainfully accuse us,\nStab our conscience, steal our worth,\nChrist will not refuse us:\nPeace the world cannot provide,\nDaily resurrection,\nStrong companion at our side\nFor each new direction.","Come and meet Him, Friend and Lord,\nThro' the gospel story:\nOpen door to life and peace,\nWindow into glory.\nAll who seek Him, soon are found,\nMade His close relation:\nChrist our pathway, Christ our home,\nChrist our sure foundation."],"chorus":""}
