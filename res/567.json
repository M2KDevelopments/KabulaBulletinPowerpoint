Have Thine Own Way, Lord","verses":["Have Thine own way, Lord!\nHave Thine own way!\nThou art the Potter;\nI am the clay.\nMold me and make me\nAfter Thy will,\nWhile I am waiting,\nYielded and still.","Have Thine own way, Lord!\nHave Thine own way!\nSearch me and try me,\nMaster, today!\nWhiter than snow, Lord,\nWash me just now,\nAs in Thy presence\nHumbly I bow.","Have Thine own way, Lord!\nHave Thine own way!\nWounded and weary\nHelp me, I pray!\nPower; all power;\nSurely is Thine!\nTouch me and heal me,\nSavior divine!","Have Thine own way, Lord!\nHave Thine own way!\nHold o'er my being\nAbsolute sway!\nFill with Thy Spirit\nTill all shall see\nChrist only, always,\nLiving in me!"],"chorus":""}
