Face to Face","verses":["Face to face with Christ my Savior,\nFace to face, what will it be,\nWhen with rapture I behold Him,\nJesus Christ, who died for me?","Only faintly now I see Him,\nWith the darkening veil between\nBut a blessed day is coming,\nWhen His glory shall be seen.","What rejoicing in His presence,\nWhen are banished grief and pain;\nWhen the crooked ways are straightened,\nAnd the dark things shall be plain!","Face to face! oh, blissful moment!\nFace to face to see and know;\nFace to face with my Redeemer,\nJesus Christ, who loves me so."],"chorus":"Face to face shall I behold Him,\nFar beyond the starry sky;\nFace to face in all His glory\nI shall see Him by and by!"}
