{"title":"727. The Lord is My Light - Psalm 27  ","number":727,"verses":["The Lord is my light and my salvation;\nWhom shall I fear?\nThe Lord is the strength of my life;\nOf whom shall I be afraid?","When the wicked came against me\nTo eat up my flesh,\nMy enemies and foes,\nThey stumbled and fell.","Though an army should encamp against me,\nMy heart shall not fear;\nThough war should rise against me,\nIn this I will be confident.","One thing I have desired of the Lord,\nThat will I seek:\nThat I may dwell in the house of the Lord\nAll the days of my life,\nTo behold the beauty of the Lord,\nAnd to inquire in His temple.","For in the time of trouble\nHe shall hide me in His pavilion;\nIn the secret place of His tabernacle\nHe shall hide me;\nHe shall set me high upon a rock.","And now my head shall be lifted up\nabove my enemies all around me;\nTherefore I will offer sacrifices of\njoy in His tabernacle; I will sing, yes,\nI will sing praises to the Lord.","When my father and my mother forsake me,\nThen the Lord will take care of me.","Teach me Your way, O Lord,\nAnd lead me in a smooth path,\nbecause of my enemies.","Wait on the Lord; Be of good courage,\nAnd He shall strengthen your heart;\nWait, I say, on the Lord!"]}
