O God, Whose Will Is Life and Good","verses":["O God, whose will is life and good\nFor all of mortal breath:\nUnite in bonds of servanthood\nAll those who strive with death.","Make strong their hands and hearts and wills\nTo drive disease afar,\nTo strive against the body's ills\nAnd wage Your healing war.","By healing of the sick and blind,\nChrist's mercy they proclaim,\nMake known the great physician's mind,\nAffirm the Savior's name.","Before them set Your gracious will,\nThat they, with heart and soul,\nTo You may consecrate their skill\nAnd make the sufferer whole."],"chorus":""}
