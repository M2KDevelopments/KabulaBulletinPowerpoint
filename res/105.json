Sing to the Great Jehovah's Praise","verses":["Sing to the great Jehovah's praise!\nAll praise to Him belongs;\nWho kindly lengthens out our days,\nInspires our choicest songs,\nInspires our choicest songs.","His providence hath brought us through\nAnother various year;\nWe all, with vows and anthems new,\nBefore our God appear,\nBefore our God appear.","O God, Thy mercies past we own,\nAnd Thy continued care;\nTo Thee presenting through Thy Son\nWhate'er we have and are,\nWhate'er we have and are."],"chorus":""}
