{"number":357,"title":"357. Come, Labor On","verses":["Come, labor on.\nWho dares stand idle on the harvest plain\nWhile all around him waves the golden grain?\nAnd to each servant does the Master say,\n\"Go work today.\"","Come, labor on.\nClaim the high calling angels cannot share;\nTo young and old the gospel gladness bear;\nRedeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly.\nThe night draws nigh.","Come, labor on.\nNo time for rest; till glows the western sky,\nTill the long shadows o'er our pathway lie,\nAnd a glad sound comes with the setting sun,\n\"Well done, well done!\""],"chorus":""}
