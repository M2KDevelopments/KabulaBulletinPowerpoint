{"number":376,"title":"376. All Things Are Thine","verses":["All things are Thine; no gift have we,\nLord of all gifts, to offer Thee;\nAnd hence with grateful hearts today,\nThine own before Thy feet we lay.","Thy will was in the builder's thought;\nThy hand unseen amidst us wrought;\nThro' mortal motive, scheme and plan,\nThy wise, eternal purpose ran.","No lack Thy perfect fullness knew;\nFor human needs and longings grew\nThis house of prayer; this home of rest.\nHere may Thy saints be often blessed.","In weakness and in want we call\nOn Thee, for whom the heav'ns are small;\nThy glory is Thy children's good,\nThy joy Thy tender Fatherhood.","O Father! deign these walls to bless;\nMake this the abode of righteousness,\nAnd let these doors a gateway be\nTo lead us from ourselves to Thee!"],"chorus":""}
