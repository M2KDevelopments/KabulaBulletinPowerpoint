Thou Didst Leave Thy Throne","verses":["Thou didst leave Thy throne\nAnd Thy kingly crown\nWhen Thou camest to earth for me;\nBut in Bethlehem's home\nWas there found no room\nFor Thy holy nativity.\nO come to my heart, Lord Jesus,\nThere is room in my heart for Thee.","Heaven's arches rang\nWhen the angels sang\nProclaiming Thy royal degree;\nBut of lowly birth\nDidst Thou come to earth,\nAnd in greatest humility.\nO come to my heart, Lord Jesus,\nThere is room in my heart for Thee.","The foxes found rest,\nAnd the birds their nest\nIn the shade of the forest tree;\nBut Thy couch was the sod,\nO Thou Son of God,\nIn the deserts of Galilee.\nO come to my heart, Lord Jesus,\nThere is room in my heart for Thee.","Thou camest, O Lord,\nWith the living word\nThat should set Thy people free;\nBut with mocking scorn,\nAnd with crown of thorn,\nThey bore Thee to Calvary.\nO come to my heart, Lord Jesus,\nThere is room in my heart for Thee.","When the heavens shall ring,\nAnd the angels sing,\nAt Thy coming to victory,\nLet Thy voice call me home,\nSaying, \"Yet there is room,\nThere is room at My side for thee.\"\nMy heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,\nWhen Thou comest and callest for me."],"chorus":""}
