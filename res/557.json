{"number":557,"title":"557. Come, Ye Thankful People","verses":["Come, ye thankful people, come,\nRaise the song of harvest home!\nAll is safely gathered in,\nEre the winter storms begin;\nGod, our Maker, doth provide\nFor our wants to be supplied;\nCome to God's own temple, come;\nRaise the song of harvest home!","We ourselves are God's own field,\nFruit unto His praise to yield;\nWheat and tares together sown,\nUnto joy or sorrow grown;\nFirst the blade and then the ear,\nThen the full corn shall appear;\nGrant, O harvest Lord, that we\nWholesome grain and pure may be.","For the Lord our God shall come,\nAnd shall take His harvest home;\nFrom His field shall purge away\nAll that doth offend, that day;\nGive His angels charge at last\nIn the fire the tares to cast,\nBut the fruitful ears to store\nIn His garner evermore.","Then, thou church triumphant, come,\nRaise the song of harvest home;\nAll are safely gathered in,\nFree from sorrow, free from sin;\nThere forever purified\nIn God's garner to abide;\nCome, ten thousand angels, come,\nRaise the glorious harvest home!"],"chorus":""}
