{"number":207,"title":"207. It May Be at Morn","verses":["It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,\nWhen sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking,\nThat Jesus will come in the fullness of glory\nTo receive from the world His own.","It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,\nIt may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight\nWill burst into light in the blaze of His glory,\nWhen Jesus receives His own.","O joy! O delight! should we go without dying,\nNo sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying,\nCaught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,\nWhen Jesus receives His own."],"chorus":"O Lord Jesus, how long, how long\nEre we shout the glad song?\nChrist returneth, Hallelujah!\nHallelujah! Amen,\nHallelujah! Amen."}
