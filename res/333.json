{"number":333,"title":"333. On Jordan's Banks the Baptist's Cry","verses":["On Jordan's banks the Baptist's cry\nAnnounces that the Lord is nigh;\nAwake and hearken, for he brings\nGlad tidings of the King of kings!","Then cleansed be every life from sin;\nMake straight the way for God within,\nAnd let us all our hearts prepare\nFor Christ to come and enter there.","We hail You as our Savior, Lord,\nOur refuge and our great reward;\nWithout Your grace we waste away\nLike flow'rs that wither and decay.","Stretch forth Your hand, our health restore,\nAnd make us rise to fall no more;\nOh, let Your face upon us shine\nAnd fill the world with love divine."],"chorus":""}
