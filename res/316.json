{"number":316,"title":"316. Live Out Thy Life Within Me","verses":["Live out Thy life within me,\nO Jesus, King of kings!\nBe Thou Thyself the answer\nTo all my questionings;\nLive out Thy life within me,\nIn all things have Thy way!\nI, the transparent medium\nThy glory to display.","The temple has been yielded,\nAnd purified of sin;\nLet Thy Shekinah glory\nNow shine forth from within,\nAnd all the earth keep silence,\nThe body henceforth be\nThy silent, gentle servant,\nMoved only as by Thee.","Its members every moment\nHeld subject to Thy call,\nReady to have Thee use them,\nOr not be used at all;\nHeld without restless longing,\nOr strain, or stress, or fret,\nOr chafings at Thy dealings,\nOr thoughts of vain regret.","But restful, calm, and pliant,\nFrom bend and bias free,\nAwaiting Thy decision,\nWhen Thou hast need of me.\nLive out Thy life within me,\nO Jesus, King of kings!\nBe Thou the glorious answer\nTo all my questionings."],"chorus":""}
