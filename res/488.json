{"number":488,"title":"488. At First I Prayed for Light","verses":["At first I prayed for light:\nCould I but see the way,\nHow gladly, swiftly would I walk\nTo everlasting day!","And next I prayed for strength:\nThat I might tread the road\nWith firm, unfaltering feet, and win\nThe heaven's serene abode.","And then I asked for faith:\nCould I but trust my God,\nI'd live infolded in His peace,\nThough foes were all abroad.","But now I pray for love:\nDeep love to God and man;\nA living love that will not fail,\nHowever dark His plan.","And light and strength and faith\nAre opening everywhere!\nGod waited patiently until\nI prayed the larger prayer."],"chorus":""}
