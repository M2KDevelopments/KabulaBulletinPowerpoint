{"number":449,"title":"449. Never Part Again","verses":["There is a land of pure delight,\r\nWhere bliss eternal reigns,\nInfinite day excludes the night\nAnd pleasures banish pain.","There everlasting spring abides,\nAnd never with'ring flowers,\nAnd but a little space divides\r\nThis heav'nly land from ours.","Could we but stand where Moses stood,\nAnd view the landscape o'er,\nNot all this world's pretended good\nCould ever charm us more."],"chorus":"We're trav'ling to Immanuel's land,\nWe soon shall hear the trumpet sound,\nAnd soon we shall with Jesus reign,\nAnd never, never part again.\nWhat! Never part again? No, never part again,\r\nWhat! Never part again? No, never part again,\r\nAnd soon we shall with Jesus reign,\nAnd never, never part again."}
