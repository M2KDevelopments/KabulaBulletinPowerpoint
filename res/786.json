{"title":"786. The New Life - Romans 6  ","number":786,"verses":["What shall we say, then?\nShould we continue to live in sin\nso that God's grace will increase?\n    ","Certainly not! We have died to sin—\nhow then can we go on living in it?\nFor when a person dies,\nhe is set free from the power of sin.\n    ","Since we have died with Christ,\nwe believe that we will also live with him.\nFor we know that Christ has been raised\nfrom death and will never die again\ndeath will no longer rule over him.\n    ","And so, because he died,\nsin has no power over him;\nand now he lives his life in fellowship with God.\nIn the same way you are to think of yourselves\nas dead, so far as sin is concerned,\nbut living in fellowship\nwith God through Christ Jesus.\n    ","Sin must no longer rule in your mortal bodies,\nso that you obey the desires of your natural self.\nNor must you surrender any part of yourselves\nto sin to be used for wicked purposes.\n    ","Instead, give yourselves to God,\nas those who have been brought from death to life,\nand surrender your whole being to him\nto be used for righteous purposes.\nSin must not be your master;\nfor you do not live under law but under God's grace.\n    ","What, then? Shall we sin,\nbecause we are not under law\nbut under God's grace? By no means!\n    ","Now you have been set free from\nsin and are the slaves of God.\nYour gain is a life fully dedicated to him,\nand the result is eternal life.\n    ","For sin pays its wage—death;\nbut God's free gift is eternal life\nin union with Christ Jesus our Lord.\n    "]}
