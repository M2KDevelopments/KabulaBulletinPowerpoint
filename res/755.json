Buy corn without money,\nand eat, and, at no cost, wine and milk.\nWhy spend money on what is not bread,\nyour wages on what fails to satisfy?","Listen, listen to me,\nand you will have good things to eat\nand rich food to enjoy.\nPay attention, come to me; listen,\nand your soul will live.","Withyou I will make an everlasting covenant\nout of the favours promised\tto David.\nSee, I have made of you a witness to the peoples,\na leader and a master of the nations.","See, you will summon a nation you never knew,\nthose unknown will come burrying\nto you, for the sake of Yahweh your God,\nof the Holy One of Israel\nwho will glorify you.","Seek Yahweh while he is still to be found,\ncall to him while he is still near.\nLet the wicked man abandon his way,\nthe evil man his thoughts.","Let him turn back to Yahweh\nwho will take pity on him,\nto our God who is rich in forgiving;\nfor my thoughts are not your thoughts,\nmy ways not your ways\nit is Yahweh who speaks.","Yes, the heavens are as high above earth\nas my ways are above your ways,\nmy thoughts above your thoughts."]}
