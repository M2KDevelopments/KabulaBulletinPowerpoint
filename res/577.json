{"number":577,"title":"577. In the Heart of Jesus","verses":["In the heart of Jesus\nThere is love for you,\nLove most pure and tender,\nLove most deep and true;\nWhy should you be lonely,\nWhy for friendship sigh,\nWhen the heart of Jesus\nHas a full supply?","In the mind of Jesus\nThere is thought for you,\nWarm as summer sunshine,\nSweet as morning dew;\nWhy should you be fearful,\nWhy take anxious thought,\nSince the mind of Jesus\nCares for those He bought?","In the field of Jesus\nThere is work for you;\nSuch as even angels\nMight rejoice to do;\nWhy stand idly sighing\nFor some lifework grand,\nWhile the field of Jesus\nSeeks your reaping hand?","In the home of Jesus\nThere's a place for you;\nGlorious, bright, and joyous,\nCalm and peaceful, too;\nWhy then, like a wanderer,\nRoam with weary pace,\nIf the home of Jesus\nHolds for you a place?"],"chorus":""}
