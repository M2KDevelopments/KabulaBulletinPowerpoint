God Is My Strong Salvation","verses":["God is my strong salvation,\nWhat foe have I to fear?\nIn darkness and temptation,\nMy Light, my Help, is near:\nThough hosts encamp around me,\nFirm in the fight I stand;\nWhat terror can confound me,\nWith God at my right hand?","Place on the Lord reliance;\nMy soul with courage wait;\nHis truth be thine affiance,\nWhen faint and desolate.\nHis might thy heart shall strengthen,\nHis love thy joy increase;\nMercy thy days shall lengthen;\nThe Lord will give thee peace."],"chorus":""}
