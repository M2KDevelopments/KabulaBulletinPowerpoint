I Love Your Kingdom, Lord","verses":["I love Your kingdom, Lord,\nThe house of Your abode,\nThe Church our blest Redeemer saved\nWith His own precious blood.","I love Your Church, O God!\nHer walls before Thee stand\nDear as the apple of Thine eye,\nAnd graven on Thy hand.","Beyond my highest joy\nI prize its heavenly ways,\nIts sweet communion, solemn vows,\nIts hymns of love and praise.","Sure as Your truth shall last,\nTo Zion shall be given\nThe brightest glories earth can yield,\nAnd brighter bliss of heaven."],"chorus":""}
