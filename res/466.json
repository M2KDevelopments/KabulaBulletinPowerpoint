{"number":466,"title":"466. Wonderful Peace","verses":["Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight,\nRolls a melody sweeter than psalm;\nIn celestial-like strains it unceasingly falls\nO'er my soul like an infinite calm.","What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace,\nBuried deep in my innermost soul,\nSo secure that no power can mine it away,\nWhile the years of eternity roll!","I believe when I rise to that city of peace,\nWhere the Author of peace I shall see,\nThat one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing,\nIn that heavenly kingdom will be;","Weary soul, without gladness or comfort or rest,\nPassing down the rough pathway of time!\nMake the Savior your friend ere the shadows grow dark;\nO accept of this peace so sublime."],"chorus":"Peace! peace! wonderful peace,\nComing down from the Father above;\nSweep over my spirit forever, I pray,\nIn fathomless billows of love."}
