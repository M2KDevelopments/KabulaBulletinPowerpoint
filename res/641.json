{"number":641,"title":"641. God in His Love For Us","verses":["God in His love for us lent us this planet,\nGave it a purpose in time and in space:\r\nSmall as a spark from the fire of creation,\nCradle of life and the home of our race.","Thanks be to God for its bounty and beauty,\nLife that sustains us in body and mind:\nPlenty for all, if we learn how to share it,\nRiches undreamed of to fathom and find.","Long have our human wars ruined its harvest;\nLong has earth bowed to the terror of forced;\nLong have we wasted what others have need of,\nPoisoned the fountain of life at its source.","Earth is the Lord's: it is ours to enjoy it,\nOurs, as His stewards, to farm and defend.\nFrom its pollution, misuse, and destruction,\nGood Lord, deliver us, world without end!"],"chorus":""}
