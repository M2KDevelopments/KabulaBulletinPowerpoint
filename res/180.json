O Listen to Our Wondrous Story","verses":["O listen to our wondrous story,\nCounted once among the lost;\nYet One came down from heaven's glory,\nSaving us at awful cost.","No angel could His place have taken,\nHighest of the high tho' he;\nThe loved One on the cross forsaken\nWas One of the Godhead three!","Will you surrender to this Savior?\nTo His scepter humbly bow;\nYou, too, shall come to know His favor,\nHe will save you, save you now."],"chorus":"Who saved us from eternal loss?\nWhat did He do? Where is He now?\nIn heaven interceding!"}
