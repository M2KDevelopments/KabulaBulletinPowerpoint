Come, Holy Spirit","verses":["Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,\nWith all Thy quickening powers;\nKindle a flame of sacred love\nIn these cold hearts of ours.","O raise our thoughts from things below,\nFrom vanities and toys!\nThen shall we with fresh courage go\nTo reach eternal joys.","Awake our souls to joyful songs;\nLet pure devotions rise;\nTill praise employs our thankful tongues,\nAnd doubt forever dies.","Father, we would no longer live\nAt this poor, dying rate;\nTo Thee our thankful love we give,\nFor Thine to us is great.","Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,\nWith all Thy quickening powers;\nCome, shed abroad a Savior's love,\nAnd that shall kindle ours."],"chorus":""}
