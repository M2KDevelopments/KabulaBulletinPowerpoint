As It Fell Upon A Night","verses":["As it fell upon a night\nIn the winter weather,\nAngels bright in starry height\nBegan to sing together.","Shepherds sleeping on the plain\nWoke to see the glory,\nAll amazed they stood and gazed\nAnd heard the angels' story.","Unto you a child is born\nIn a manger lowly,\nHumble, He, yet born to be\r\nThe King of Love most holy.","Happy angels from afar,\nCease your singing never!\nIn excelsis gloria!\nForever and forever."],"chorus":""}
