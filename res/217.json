The Church Has Waited Long","verses":["The church has waited long\nHer absent Lord to see;\nAnd still in loneliness she waits,\nA friendless stranger she.","How long, O Lord our God,\nHoly and true and good,\nWilt Thou not judge Thy suffering church,\nHer sighs and tears and blood?","We long to hear Thy voice,\nTo see Thee face to face,\nTo share Thy crown and glory then,\nAs now we share Thy grace.","Come, Lord, and wipe away\nThe curse, the sin, the stain,\nAnd make this blighted world of ours\nThine own fair world again."],"chorus":""}
