{"title":"724. O Lord, You Have Searched Me - Psalm 139  ","number":724,"verses":["O Lord, You have searched me and known me.\nYou know my sitting down and my rising up;\nYou understand my thought afar off.\n    ","You comprehend my path and my lying down,\nAnd are acquainted with all my ways.\nFor there is not a word on my tongue,\nBut behold, O Lord,\tYou know it altogether.\n    ","You have hedged me behind and before,\nAnd laid Your hand upon me.\nSuch knowledge is too wonderful for me;\nIt is high, I cannot attain it.\n    ","Where can I go from Your Spirit?\nOr where can I flee from Your presence?\nIf I ascend into heaven, You are there;\nIf I make my bed in hell,\nbehold, You are there.\n    ","If I take the wings of the morning,\nAnd dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,\nEven there Your hand shall lead me,\nAnd Your right hand shall hold me.\n    ","If I say, \"Surely the darkness shall fall on me,\"\nEven the night shall be light about me;\nIndeed, the darkness shall not hide from You,\nBut the night shines as the day;\nThe darkness and the light are both alike to You.\n    ","For You have formed my inward parts;\nYou have covered me in my mother's womb.\nI will praise You,\nfor I am fearfully and wonderfully made;\nMarvelous are Your works,\nAnd that my soul knows very well.\n    ","Search me, O God, and know my heart;\nTry me, and know my anxieties;\nAnd see if there is any wicked way in me,\nAnd lead me in the way everlasting.\n    "]}
