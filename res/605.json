My Soul, Be on Thy Guard","verses":["My soul, be on thy guard!\nTen thousand foes arise;\nThe hosts of sin are pressing hard\nTo draw thee from the skies.","O watch, and fight, and pray!\nThe battle ne'er give o'er;\nRenew it boldly every day,\nAnd help divine implore.","Ne'er think the victory won,\nNor lay thine armor down;\nThy arduous task will not be done\nTill thou obtain the crown."],"chorus":""}
