{"number":500,"title":"500. Take Time to Be Holy","verses":["Take time to be holy,\nSpeak oft with thy Lord;\nAbide in Him always,\nAnd feed on His word;\nMake friends of God's children,\nHelp those who are weak,\nForgetting in nothing\nHis blessing to seek.","Take time to be holy,\nThe world rushes on;\nSpend much time in secret\nWith Jesus alone;\nBy looking to Jesus,\nLike Him thou shalt be;\nThy friends in thy conduct\nHis likeness shall see.","Take time to be holy,\nLet Him be thy Guide,\nAnd run not before Him,\nWhatever betide;\nIn joy or in sorrow,\nStill follow thy Lord,\nAnd, looking to Jesus,\nStill trust in His word.","Take time to be holy,\nBe calm in thy soul,\nEach thought and each motive\nBeneath His control;\nThus led by His Spirit\nTo fountains of love,\nThou soon shalt be fitted\nFor service above."],"chorus":""}
