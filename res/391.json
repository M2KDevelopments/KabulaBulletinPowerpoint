{"number":391,"title":"391. Welcome, Welcome, Day of Rest","verses":["Welcome, welcome, day of rest,\nTo the world in kindness given;\nWelcome to this humble breast,\nAs the beaming light from heaven.","Day of calm and sweet repose,\nGently now thy moments run;\nBalm to soothe our cares and woes,\nTill our labor here is done.","Holy day that most we prize,\nDay of solemn praise and prayer,\nDay to make the simple wise,\nO, how great thy blessings are!","Welcome, welcome, day of rest,\nWith thy influence all divine;\nMay thy hallowed hours be blessed\nTo this waiting heart of mine."],"chorus":""}
