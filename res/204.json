Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus","verses":["Come, Thou long expected Jesus!\nBorn to set Thy people free,\nFrom our fears and sins release us,\nLet us find our rest in Thee.\nIsrael's strength and consolation,\nHope of all the earth Thou art;\nDear Desire of every nation,\nJoy of every longing heart.","Born Thy people to deliver,\nBorn a child, and yet a King,\nBorn to reign in us forever,\nNow Thy gracious kingdom bring,\nBy Thy own eternal Spirit,\nRule in all our hearts alone;\nBy Thy all sufficient merit,\nRaise us to Thy glorious throne."],"chorus":""}
