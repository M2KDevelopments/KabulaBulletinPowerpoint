Nature With Open Volume Stands","verses":["Nature with open volume stands,\nTo spread its Maker's praise abroad;\nAnd every labor of His hands\nShows something worthy of our God.","But in the grace that rescued us\nHis brightest form of glory shines;\n'Tis fairest drawn upon the cross\nIn precious blood and crimson lines.","Here His whole name appears complete.\nNor wit can guess, nor reason prove,\nWhich of the letters best is writ,\nThe pow'r, the wisdom, or the love.","We would forever speak His name\nIn sounds to mortal ears unknown,\nWith angels join to praise the Lamb,\nAnd worship at His Father's throne."],"chorus":""}
