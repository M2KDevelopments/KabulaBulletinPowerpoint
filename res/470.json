There's Sunshine in My Soul Today","verses":["There's sunshine in my soul today,\nMore glorious and bright,\nThan glows in any earthly sky,\nFor Jesus is my light.","There's music in my soul today,\nA carol to my King,\nAnd Jesus, listening, can hear\nThe songs I cannot sing.","There's springtime in my soul today,\nFor when the Lord is near,\nThe dove of peace sings in my heart,\nThe flowers of grace appear.","There's gladness in my soul today,\nAnd hope, and praise, and love,\nFor blessings which He gives me now,\nFor joys \"laid up\" above."],"chorus":"O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,\nWhen the peaceful, happy moments roll;\nWhen Jesus shows His smiling face\nThere is sunshine in the soul."}
