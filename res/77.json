O Love of God Most Full","verses":["O love of God most full,\nO love of God most free,\nCome warm my heart, come fill my soul,\nCome lead me unto Thee.","Warm as the glowing sun\nSo shines Thy love on me,\nIt wraps me 'round with kindly care,\nIt draws me unto Thee.","The wildest sea is calm,\nThe tempest brings no fear,\nThe darkest night is full of light,\nBecause Thy love is near.","O love of God most full,\nO love of God most free,\nIt warms my heart, it fills my soul,\nWith might it strengthens me."],"chorus":""}
