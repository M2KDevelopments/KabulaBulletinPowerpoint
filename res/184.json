Jesus Paid It All","verses":["I hear the Savior say,\n\"Thy strength indeed is small;\nChild of weakness, watch and pray,\nFind in Me thine all in all.\"","Lord, now indeed I find\nThy power, and Thine alone,\nCan change the leper's spots,\nAnd melt the heart of stone.","Since nothing good have I\nWhereby Thy grace to claim,\nI'll wash my garment white\nIn the blood of Calvary's Lamb.","And when before the throne\nI stand in Him complete,\nI'll lay my trophies down,\nAll down at Jesus' feet."],"chorus":"Jesus paid it all,\nAll to Him I owe;\nSin had left a crimson stain;\nHe washed it white as snow."}
