{"number":46,"title":"46. Abide With Me, 'Tis Eventide","verses":["Abide with me, 'tis eventide!\nThe day is past and gone;\nThe shadows of the evening fall;\nThe night is coming on!\nWithin my heart a welcome guest,\nWithin my home abide;","Abide with me, 'tis eventide!\nThy walk today with me\nHas made my heart within me burn,\nAs I communed with Thee.\nThy earnest words have filled my soul\nAnd kept me near Thy side;","Abide with me, 'tis eventide!\nAnd lone will be the night,\nIf I cannot commune with Thee,\nNor find in Thee my light.\nThe darkness of the world, I fear,\nWould in my home abide;"],"chorus":"O Savior, stay this night with me;\nBehold, 'tis eventide!\nO Savior, stay this night with me;\nBehold, 'tis eventide."}
