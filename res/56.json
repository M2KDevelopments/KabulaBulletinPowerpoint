{"number":56,"title":"56. The Day Thou Gavest","verses":["The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended,\nThe darkness falls at Thy behest;\nTo Thee our morning hymns ascended,\nThy praise shall hallow now our rest.","We thank Thee that Thy church, unsleeping,\nWhile earth rolls onward into light,\nThrough all the world her watch is keeping,\nAnd rests not now by day or night.","As o'er each continent and island\nThe dawn leads on another day,\nThe voice of prayer is never silent,\nNor die the strains of praise away.","So be it, Lord; Thy throne shall never,\nLike earth's proud empires, pass away;\nThy kingdom stands, and grows forever,\nTill all Thy creatures own Thy sway."],"chorus":""}
