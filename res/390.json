We Love Thy Sabbath, Lord","verses":["We love Thy Sabbath, Lord,\nAnd worship at Thy will;\nOh may these hours sweet peace afford\nAnd deeper faith instill.","Thine angels sang for joy\nCreation's work to see;\nWe too, this day, would raise our hearts\nIn grateful praise to Thee.","Praise for Thy wondrous love,\nThat sealed this sacred day,\nA sign that all may understand\nWe own Thy sovereign sway.","O great Creator King,\nThrough Thy redeeming grace,\nRenew and sanctify our hearts\nThat we may see Thy face.","And with the white-robed throng,\nUpon Mount Sion be,\nAnd joyful sing our Sabbath song\nThrough all eternity."],"chorus":""}
