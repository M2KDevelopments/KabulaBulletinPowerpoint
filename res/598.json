{"number":598,"title":"598. Watch, Ye Saints","verses":["Watch, ye saints, with eyelids waking;\nLo! the powers of heaven are shaking;\nKeep your lamps all trimmed and burning,\nReady for your Lord's returning.","Lo! the promise of your Savior,\nPardoned sin and purchased favor,\nBlood-washed robes and crowns of glory;\nHaste to tell redemption's story.","Kingdoms at their base are crumbling,\nHark! His chariot wheels are rumbling,\nTell, O tell of grace abounding,\nWhile the seventh trump is sounding.","Nations wane, though proud and stately;\nChrist His kingdom hasteneth greatly;\nEarth her latest pangs is summing;\nShout, ye saints, your Lord is coming.","Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading;\nNow for you He's interceding;\nHaste, ere grace and time diminished\nShall proclaim the mystery finished."],"chorus":"Lo! He comes, lo! Jesus comes;\nLo! He comes, He comes all-glorious!\nJesus comes to reign victorious, Lo!\nHe comes, yes, Jesus comes."}
