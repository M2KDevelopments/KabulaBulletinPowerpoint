{"number":34,"title":"34. Wake the Song","verses":["Wake the song of joy and gladness;\nHither bring your noblest lays;\nBanish every thought of sadness,\nPouring forth your highest praise.\nSing to Him whose care has brought us\nOnce again with friends to meet,\nAnd whose loving voice has taught us\nOf the way to Jesus' feet.","Joyfully with songs and banners,\nWe will greet the festal day;\nShout aloud our glad hosannas,\nAnd our grateful homage pay.\nWe will chant our Savior's glory\nWhile our thoughts we raise above,\nTelling still \"the old, old story,\"\nPrecious theme redeeming love!","Thanks to Thee, O holy Father,\nFor the mercies of the year;\nMay each heart, as here we gather,\nSwell with gratitude sincere.\nThanks to Thee, O loving Savior,\nFor redemption through Thy blood.\nBreathe upon us, Holy Spirit,\nSweetly draw us near to God."],"chorus":"Wake the song, wake the song,\nThe song of joy and gladness,\nWake the song, wake the song,\nThe song of Jubilee."}
