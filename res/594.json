{"number":594,"title":"594. Heir of the Kingdom","verses":["Heir of the kingdom, O why dost thou slumber?\nWhy art thou sleeping so near thy blest home?\nWake thee, arouse thee, and gird on thine armor,\nSpeed, for the moments are hurrying on.","Heir of the kingdom, say, why dost thou linger?\nHow canst thou tarry in sight of the prize?\nUp, and adorn thee, the Savior is coming;\nHaste to receive Him descending the skies.","Earth's mighty nations, in strife and commotion,\nTremble with terror, and sink in dismay;\nListen, 'tis nought but the chariot's loud rumbling;\nHeir of the kingdom, no longer delay.","Stay not, O stay not for earth's vain allurements!\nSee how its glory is passing away;\nBreak the strong fetters the foe hath bound o'er thee;\nHeir of the kingdom, turn, turn thee away.","Keep the eye single, the head upward lifted;\nWatch for the glory of earth's coming King;\nLo! o'er the mountaintops light is now breaking;\nHeirs of the kingdom, rejoice ye and sing."],"chorus":""}
