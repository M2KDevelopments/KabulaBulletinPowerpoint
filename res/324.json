Just as I Am, Thine Own to Be","verses":["Just as I am, Thine own to be,\nFriend of the young, who lovest me,\nTo consecrate myself to Thee,\nO Jesus Christ, I come.","In the glad morning of my day,\nMy life to give, my vows to pay,\nWith no reserve and no delay,\nWith all my heart I come.","I would live ever in the light;\nI would work ever for the right;\nI would serve Thee with all my might;\nTherefore, to Thee I come.","Just as I am, young, strong, and free,\nTo be the best that I can be\nFor truth, and righteousness, and Thee,\nLord of my life, I come."],"chorus":""}
