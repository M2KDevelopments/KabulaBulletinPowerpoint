{"number":209,"title":"209. That Glorious Day Is Coming","verses":["That glorious day is coming,\nThe hour is hastening on;\nIts radiant light is nearing,\nFar brighter than the sun;\nIn yonder clouds of heaven,\nThe Savior will appear,\nAnd gather all His chosen,\nTo meet Him in the air.","The saints, then all victorious\nWill go to meet their Lord;\nAn earth both bright and glorious,\nWill then be their reward;\nAnd God Himself there reigning,\nWill wipe all tears away;\nNor clouds nor night remaining,\nBut one eternal day.","O Christian, keep from sleeping,\nAnd let your love abound;\nBe watchful, prayerful, faithful,\nThe trumpet soon will sound!\nO sinner, hear the warning!\nTo Jesus quickly!\nThen you, in that blest morning,\nMay meet Him in the sky!"],"chorus":""}
