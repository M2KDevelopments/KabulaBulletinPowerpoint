{"number":40,"title":"40. The Dawn of God's Dear Sabbath","verses":["The dawn of God's dear Sabbath\nBreaks o'er the earth again,\nAs some sweet summer morning\nAfter a night of pain;\nIt comes as cooling showers\nTo some exhausted land,\nAs shade of clustered palm trees\n'Mid weary wastes of sand.","Lord, we would bring for offering,\nThough marred with earthly soil,\nA week of earnest labor,\nOf steady, faithful toil,\nFair fruits of self-denial,\nOf strong, deep love to Thee,\nFostered by Thine own Spirit,\nIn true humility.","And we would bring our burden\nOf sinful thought and deed,\nIn Thy pure presence kneeling,\nFrom bondage to be freed,\nOur heart's most bitter sorrow\nFor all Thy work undone;\nSo many talents wasted!\nSo few bright laurels won!","And with that sorrow mingling,\nA steadfast faith, and sure,\nAnd love so deep and fervent,\nFor Thee to make it pure,\nIn Thy dear presence finding\nThe pardon that we need,\nAnd then the peace so lasting\nCelestial peace indeed."],"chorus":""}
