{"number":285,"title":"285. Jesus Calls Us","verses":["Jesus calls us; o'er the tumult\nOf our life's wild, restless sea,\nDay by day His sweet voice soundeth,\nSaying, \"Christian, follow Me.\"","Jesus calls us from the worship\nOf the vain world's golden store,\nFrom each idol that would keep us,\nSaying, \"Christian, love Me more.\"","In our joys and in our sorrows,\nDays of toil and hours of ease,\nStill He calls, in cares and pleasures,\n\"Christian, love Me more than these.\"","Jesus calls us! By Thy mercies,\nSavior, may we hear Thy call,\nGive our hearts to Thy obedience,\nServe and love Thee best of all."],"chorus":""}
