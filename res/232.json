{"number":232,"title":"232. At the Name of Jesus","verses":["At the name of Jesus\nEvery knee shall bow,\nEvery tongue confess Him\nKing of glory now;\n'Tis the Father's pleasure\nWe should call Him Lord,\nWho from the beginning\nWas the mighty Word.","At His voice creation\nSprang at once to sight,\nAll the angel faces,\nAll the hosts of light,\nThrones and dominations\nStars upon their way,\nAll the heavenly orders\nIn their great array.","Humbled for a season,\nTo receive a name\nFrom the lips of sinners,\nUnto whom He came;\nHe is God the Savior,\nHe is Christ the Lord,\nEver to be worshiped,\nTrusted and adored.","In your hearts enthrone Him:\nThere let Him subdue\nAll that is not holy,\nAll that is not true;\nCrown Him as your captain\nIn temptation's hour,\nLet His will enfold you\nIn its light and power."],"chorus":""}
