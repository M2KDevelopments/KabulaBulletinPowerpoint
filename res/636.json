{"number":636,"title":"636. God Whose Giving Knows No Ending","verses":["God, whose giving knows no ending,\nFrom Your rich and endless store:\nNature's wonder, Jesus' wisdom,\r\nCostly cross, grave's shattered door.\nGifted by You, we turn to You,\nOff'ring up ourselves in praise:\nThankful song shall rise forever,\nGracious donor of our days.","Skills and time are ours for pressing\nToward the goals of Christ, Your Son:\nAll at peace in health and freedom,\nRaces joined, the church made one.\nNow direct our daily labor,\nLest we strive for self alone:\nBorn with talents, make us servants\nFit to answer at Your throne.","Treasure, too, You have entrusted,\nGain through pow'rs Your grace conferred:\nOurs to use for home and kindred,\nAnd to spread the Gospel Word.\nOpen wide our hands in sharing,\nAs we heed Christ's ageless call.\nHealing, teaching, and reclaiming,\nServing You by loving all."],"chorus":""}
