{"number":595,"title":"595. Let Every Lamp Be Burning","verses":["Let every lamp be burning bright,\nThe darkest hour is nearing;\nThe darkest hour of earth's long night,\nBefore the Lord's appearing.","Though thousands calmly slumber on,\nThe last great message spurning,\nWe'll rest our living faith upon\nHis promise of returning.","His word our lamp, His truth our guide,\nWe cannot be mistaken;\nThough dangers rise on every side,\nWe shall not be forsaken.","Then let good works with faith appear,\nTo help the world around us;\nObedience brings the blessing near\nWhen faith has firmly bound us."],"chorus":"Then trim your lamps, my brethren dear,\nThen trim your lamps with godly fear;\nThe Master's coming draweth near,\nLet every lamp be burning."}
