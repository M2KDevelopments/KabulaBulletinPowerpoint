{"number":560,"title":"560. Let All Things Now Living","verses":["Let all things now living a song of thanksgiving\nTo God the Creator triumphantly raise,\nWho fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us,\nWho guideth us on to the end of our days.\nHis banners are o'er us, His light goes before us,\nA pillar of fire shining forth in the night,\n'Til shadows have vanished and darkness is banished,\nAs forward we travel from light into light.","His law He enforces: the stars in their courses,\nThe sun in His orbit, obediently shine;\nThe hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains,\nThe deeps of the ocean proclaim Him divine,\nWe too should be voicing our love and rejoicing,\nWith glad adoration a song let us raise,\n'Til all things now living unite in thanksgiving\r\nTo God in the highest, hosanna and praise."],"chorus":""}
