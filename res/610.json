{"number":610,"title":"610. Stand Like the Brave","verses":["O Christian, awake! 'tis the Master's command;\nWith helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand,\nTo meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go,\nThen stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.","The cause of thy Master with vigor defend;\nBe watchful, be zealous, and fight to the end;\nWherever He leads thee, go, valiantly go,\nThen stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.","Press on, never doubting, thy Captain is near,\nWith grace to supply, and with comfort to cheer;\nHis love, like a stream in the desert will flow;\nThen stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe."],"chorus":"Stand like the brave, stand like the brave,\nStand like the brave, with thy face to the foe."}
