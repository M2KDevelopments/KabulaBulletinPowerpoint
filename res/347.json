{"number":347,"title":"347. Built On the Rock","verses":["Built on the Rock the Church shall stand,\nEven when steeples are falling;\nCrumbled have spires in every land,\nBells still are chiming and calling-\nCalling the young and old to rest,\nCalling the souls of those distressed,\nLonging for life everlasting.","Not in our temples made with hands\nGod, the Almighty, is dwelling;\nHigh in the heav'ns His temple stands,\nAll earthly temples excelling.\nYet He who dwells in heav'n above\nDeigns to abide with us in love,\nMaking our bodies His temple.","We are God's house of living stones,\nBuilt for His own habitation;\nHe fills our hearts, His humble thrones,\nGranting us life and salvation.\nWere two or three to seek His face,\nHe in their midst would show His grace,\nBlessings upon them bestowing.","Yet in this house, an earthly frame,\nJesus His children is blessing;\nHither we come to praise His name,\nFaith in our Savior confessing.\nJesus to us His Spirit sent,\nMaking with us His covenant,\nGranting His children the kingdom.","Thro' all the passing years, O Lord,\nGrant that, when church bells are ringing,\nMany may come to hear God's Word\r\nWhere He this promise is bringing:\nI know My own, My own know Me:\nYou, not the world, My face shall see;\nMy peace I leave with you. Amen."],"chorus":""}
