Spring Has Now Unwrapped the Flowers","verses":["Spring has now unwrapped the flowers,\nDay is fast reviving,\nLife in all her growing powers\nTowards the light is striving:\nGone the iron touch of cold,\nWinter time and frost time,\nSeedlings, working through the mould,\nNow make up for lost time.","Herb and plant that winter long,\nSlumbered at their leisurek,\nNow bestirring, green and strong,\nFind in growth their pleasure:\nAll the world with beauty fills,\nGold the green enhancing;\nFlowers make glee among the hills,\nSet the meadows dancing.","Through each wonder of fair days\nGod Himself expresses;\nBeauty follows all His ways,\r\nAs the world He blesses:\nSo, as He renews the earth,\nArtist without rival,\nIn His grace of glad new birth\nWe must seek revival."],"chorus":""}
