{"number":442,"title":"442. How Sweet Are the Tidings","verses":["How sweet are the tidings that greet the pilgrim's ear,\nAs he wanders in exile from home!\nSoon, soon will the Savior in glory appear,\nAnd soon will the kingdom come.","The mossy old graves where the pilgrims sleep\nShall be open as wide as before,\nAnd the millions that sleep in the mighty deep\nShall live on this earth once more.","There we'll meet ne'er to part in our happy Eden home,\nSweet songs of redemption we'll sing;\nFrom the north, from the south, all the ransomed shall come,\nAnd worship our heavenly King.","Hallelujah, Amen! hallelujah again!\nSoon, if faithful, we all shall be there;\nO, be watchful, be hopeful, be joyful till then,\nAnd a crown of bright glory we'll wear."],"chorus":"He's coming, coming, coming soon I know,\nComing back to this earth again;\nAnd the weary pilgrims will to glory go,\nWhen the Savior comes to reign."}
