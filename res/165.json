{"number":165,"title":"165. Look, You Saints! the Sight Is Glorious","verses":["Look, you saints, the sight is glorious,\nSee the Man of sorrows now;\nFrom the fight returned victorious,\nEvery knee to Him shall bow.\nCrown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!\nCrown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!\nCrowns become the victor's brow.\nCrowns become the victor's brow.","Crown the Savior! angels crown Him!\nRich the trophies Jesus bring;\nOn the seat of power enthrone Him\nWhile the vault of heaven rings.\nCrown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!\nCrown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!\nCrown the Savior, King of kings.\nCrown the Savior, King of kings.","Sinners in derision crowned Him,\nMocking thus the Savior's claim;\nSaints and angels crowd around Him,\nOwn His title, praise His name.\nCrown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!\nCrown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!\nSpread abroad the victor's fame!\nSpread abroad the victor's fame!","Hark! those bursts of acclamation!\nHark! those loud triumphant chords!\nJesus takes the highest station;\nOh, what joy the sight affords.\nCrown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!\nCrown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!\nKing of kings and Lord of lords!\nKing of kings and Lord of lords!"],"chorus":""}
