My Maker and My King","verses":["My Maker and my King,\nTo Thee my all I owe;\nThy sovereign bounty is the spring\nWhence all my blessings flow;\nThy sovereign bounty is the spring\nWhence all my blessings flow.","The creature of Thy hand,\nOn Thee alone I live;\nMy God, Thy benefits demand\nMore praise than I can give.\nMy God, Thy benefits demand\nMore praise than I can give.","Lord, what can I impart\nWhen all is Thine before?\nThy love demands a thankful heart;\nThe gift, alas! how poor.\nThy love demands a thankful heart;\nThe gift, alas! how poor.","O! let Thy grace inspire\nMy soul with strength divine;\nLet every word and each desire\nAnd all my days be Thine.\nLet every word and each desire\nAnd all my days be Thine."],"chorus":""}
