Heavenly Father, Bless Us Now","verses":["Heavenly Father, bless us now;\nAt the cross of Christ we bow;\nTake our guilt and grief away;\nHear and heal us now, we pray.","Now, O Lord, this very hour,\nSend Thy grace and show Thy power;\nWhile we rest upon Thy word,\nCome, and bless us now, O Lord!","Mercy now, O Lord, we plead\nIn this hour of utter need;\nTurn us not away unblest;\nCalm our anguish into rest.","O Thou loving, blessed One,\nRising o'er us like the sun,\nLight and life art Thou within:\nSavior, Thou, from every sin!"],"chorus":""}
