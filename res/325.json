{"number":325,"title":"325. Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken","verses":["Jesus, I my cross have taken,\nAll to leave and follow Thee;\nAll things else I have forsaken;\nThou from hence my all shalt be.\nPerish every fond ambition,\nAll I've sought, or hoped, or known;\nYet how rich is my condition,\nWhile I prove the Lord my own.","Let the world despise and leave me;\nThey have left my Savior, too;\nHuman hearts and looks deceive me;\nThou art faithful, Thou art true.\nO, 'tis not in grief to harm me,\nWhile Thy love is left to me;\nO, 'twere not in joy to charm me,\nIf that love be hid from me.","Soul, then know thy full salvation;\nRise o'er sin, and fear, and care;\nJoy to find in every station\nSomething still to do or bear.\nThink what Spirit dwells within thee;\nThink what Father's smiles are thine;\nThink that Jesus died to win thee;\nChild of Heaven, canst thou repine?","Haste thee on from grace to glory,\nArmed by faith and winged by prayer;\nHeaven's eternal day's before thee;\nGod's own hand shall guide thee there.\nSoon shall close thy earthly mission,\nSoon shall pass thy pilgrim days;\nHope shall change to glad fruition,\nFaith to sight, and prayer to praise."],"chorus":""}
