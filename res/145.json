{"number":145,"title":"145. Songs of Thankfulness and Praise","verses":["Songs of thankfulness and praise,\nJesus, Lord, to You we raise,\nManifested by the star\nTo the sages from afar;\nBranch of royal David's stem\nIn Your birth at Bethlehem;\nAnthems be to You addressed,\nGod in man made manifest.","Manifest at Jordan's stream,\nProphet, Priest, and King supreme;\nAnd at Cana, wedding guest,\nIn Your Godhead manifest;\nManifest in power divine,\nChanging water into wine;\nAnthems be to You addressed,\nGod in man made manifest.","Manifest in making whole\nPalsied limbs and fainting soul;\nManifest in valiant fight,\nQuelling all the devil's might;\nManifest in gracious will,\nEver bringing good from ill;\nAnthems be to You addressed,\nGod in man made manifest.","Grant us grace to see You, Lord,\nMirrored in Your holy Word;\nMay we imitate Your way,\nAnd be pure, as pure we may,\nThat we like to You may be\nAt Your great epiphany;\nLet us praise You, ever blest,\nGod in man made manifest."],"chorus":""}
