{"number":480,"title":"480. Dear Lord and Father","verses":["Dear Lord and Father of mankind,\nForgive our foolish ways;\nReclothe us in our rightful mind,\nIn purer lives Thy service find,\nIn deeper reverence praise,\nIn deeper reverence, praise.","In simple trust like theirs who heard,\nBeside the Syrian sea,\nThe gracious calling of the Lord,\nLet us, like them, without a word,\nRise up and follow Thee,\nRise up and follow Thee.","O Sabbath rest by Galilee,\nO calm of hills above,\nWhere Jesus knelt to share with Thee\nThe silence of eternity,\nInterpreted by love,\nInterpreted by love.","Drop Thy still dews of quietness,\nTill all our strivings cease;\nTake from our souls the strain and stress,\nAnd let our ordered lives confess\nThe beauty of Thy peace,\nThe beauty of Thy peace.","Breathe thro' the heats of our desire,\nThy coolness and Thy balm;\nLet sense be dumb, let flesh retire;\nSpeak thro' the earthquake, wind, and fire,\nO still small voice of calm,\nO still small voice of calm."],"chorus":""}
