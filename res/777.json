{"title":"777. Christian Unity - Ephesians 4  ","number":777,"verses":["As a prisoner for the Lord, then,\nI urge you to live a life worthy of\nthe calling you have received.\n    ","Be completely humble and gentle; be patient,\nbearing with one another in love.\nMake every effort to keep the unity of\nthe Spirit through the bond of peace.\n    ","There is one body and one Spirit—\njust as you were called to one hope\nwhen you were called—\none Lord, one faith, one baptism;\none God and Father of all,\nwho is over all and through all and in all.\n    ","But to each one of us grace has been\ngiven as Christ apportioned it.\nThis is why it says:\n\"When he ascended on high,\nhe led captives in his train\nand gave gifts to men.\"\n    ","It was he who gave some to be apostles,\nsome to be prophets, some to be evangelists,\nand some to be pastors and teachers,\n    ","To prepare God's people\nfor works of service,\nso that the body of Christ may\nbe built up until we all reach unity\nin the faith and in the knowledge of the\nSon of God and become mature,\nattaining to the whole measure\nof the fullness of Christ.\n    ","Then we will no longer be infants,\ntossed back and forth by the waves,\nand blown here and there\nby every wind of teaching and by\nthe cunning and craftiness of\nmen in their deceitful scheming.\n    ","Instead, speaking the truth in love,\nwe will in all things grow up into\nhim who is the Head, that is, Christ.\nFrom him the whole body,\njoined and held together\nby every supporting ligament,\ngrows and builds itself up in love,\nas each part does its work.\n    "]}
