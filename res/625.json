{"number":625,"title":"625. Higher Ground","verses":["I'm pressing on the upward way,\nNew heights I'm gaining every day;\nStill praying as I onward bound,\n\"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.\"","My heart has no desire to stay\nWhere doubts arise and fears dismay;\nThough some may dwell where these abound,\nMy prayer, my aim is higher ground.","I want to live above the world,\nThough Satan's darts at me are hurled;\nFor faith has caught the joyful sound,\nThe song of saints on higher ground.","I want to scale the utmost height,\nAnd catch a gleam of glory bright;\nBut still I'll pray till heaven I've found,\n\"Lord, lead me on to higher ground.\""],"chorus":"Lord, lift me up, and I shall stand\nBy faith, on heaven's tableland;\nA higher plane than I have found;\nLord, plant my feet on higher ground."}
