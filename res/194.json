{"number":194,"title":"194. Sing We of the Modern City","verses":["Sing we of the modern city,\nScene alike of joy and stress;\nSing we of its namelss people\nIn their urban wilderness.\nInto endless rows of houses\nLife is set a millionfold,\nLife expressed in human beings\nDaily born and growing old.","In the city full of people,\nWorld of speed and hectic days,\nIn the everchanging setting\r\nOf the latest trend and craze,\nChrist is present, and among us;\nIn the crowd we see Him stand.\nIn the bustle of the city\nJesus Christ is every man.","God is not remote in heaven,\nBut on earth to share our shame,\nChanging graph and mass and number\nInto persons with a name.\nChrist has shown, beyond statistics,\nHuman life with glory crowned,\nBy His timeless presence proving\r\nPeople matter, people count!"],"chorus":""}
