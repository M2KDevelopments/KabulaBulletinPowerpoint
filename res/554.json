{"number":554,"title":"554. O Let Me Walk With Thee","verses":["O let me walk with Thee, my God,\nAs Enoch walked in days of old;\nPlace Thou my trembling hand in Thine,\nAnd sweet communion with me hold;\nE'en though the path I may not see,\nYet, Jesus, let me walk with Thee.","I cannot, dare not, walk alone;\nThe tempest rages in the sky,\nA thousand snares beset my feet,\nA thousand foes are lurking nigh.\nStill Thou the raging of the sea,\nO Master! let me walk with Thee.","If I may rest my hand in Thine,\nI'Il count the joys of earth but loss,\nAnd firmly, bravely journey on;\nI'll bear the banner of the cross\nTill Zion's glorious gates I see;\nYet, Savior, let me walk with Thee."],"chorus":""}
