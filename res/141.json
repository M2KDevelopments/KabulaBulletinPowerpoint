What Child Is This?","verses":["What child is this, who, laid to rest,\nOn Mary's lap is sleeping?\nWhom angels greet with anthems sweet,\nWhile shepherds watch are keeping?","Why lies He in such mean estate\nWhere ox and ass are feeding?\nGood Christian, fear: for sinners here\nThe silent Word is pleading.","So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,\nCome, peasant, king, to own Him,\nThe King of kings salvation brings\nLet loving hearts enthrone Him."],"chorus":"This, this is Christ the King,\nWhom shepherds guard and angels sing:\nHaste, haste to bring Him laud,\nThe babe, the son of Mary."}
