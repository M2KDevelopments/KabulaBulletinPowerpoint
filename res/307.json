{"number":307,"title":"307. I Am Coming to the Cross","verses":["I am coming to the cross;\nI am poor, and weak, and blind\nI am counting all but dross;\nI shall full salvation find.","Long my heart has sighed for Thee;\nLong has evil reigned within;\nJesus sweetly speaks to me,\n\"I will cleanse you from all sin.\"","Here I give my all to Thee;\nFriends, and time, and earthly store;\nSoul and body Thine to be,\nWholly Thine forevermore.","Jesus comes! He fills my soul!\nPerfected in Him I am;\nI am every whit made whole;\nGlory, glory to the Lamb!"],"chorus":"I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,\nO Thou Lamb of Calvary;\nHumbly at Thy cross I bow;\nSave me, Jesus, save me now."}
