{"number":167,"title":"167. Alleluia Sing to Jesus","verses":["Alleluia! sing to Jesus!\nHis the scepter, His the throne;\nAlleluia! His the triumph,\nHis the victory alone;\nHark! the songs of peaceful Sion\nThunder like a mighty flood;\nJesus out of every nation\nHath redeemed us by His blood.","Alleluia! not as orphans\nAre we left in sorrow now;\nAlleluia! He is near us,\nFaith believes, nor questions how:\nThough the cloud from sight received Him,\nWhen the forty days were o'er,\nShall our hearts forget His promise,\n\"I am with you evermore\"?","Alleluia! Bread of heaven,\nThou on earth our food, our stay!\nAlleluia! here the sinful\r\nFlee to Thee from day to day:\nIntercessor, Friend of sinners,\nEarth's Redeemer plead for me,\nWhere the songs of all the sinless\nSweep across the crystal sea."],"chorus":""}
