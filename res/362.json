Lift High the Cross","verses":["Come, Christians, follow where our Captain trod,\nOur King victorious, Christ, the Son of God.","Led on their way by this triumphant sign,\nThe hosts of God in conqu'ring ranks combine.","All newborn soldiers of the Crucified\nBear on their brows the seal of Him who died.","O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,\nAs Thou hast promised, draw men unto Thee.","So shall our song of triumph ever be:\nPraise to the Crucified for victory!"],"chorus":"Lift high the Cross, the love of Christ proclaim,\nTill all the world adore His sacred name."}
