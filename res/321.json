My Jesus, I Love Thee","verses":["My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;\nFor Thee all the follies of sin I resign;\nMy gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou;\nIf ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.","I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,\nAnd purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;\nI love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;\nIf ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.","I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee 'til death,\nAnd praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;\nAnd say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,\nIf ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.","In mansions of glory and endless delight,\nI'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;\nI'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,\nIf ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now."],"chorus":""}
