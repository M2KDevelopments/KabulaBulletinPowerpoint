O Holy Dove of God Descending","verses":["O holy Dove of God descending,\nYou are the love that knows no ending.\nAll of our shattered dreams You're mending:\nSpirit, now live in me.","O holy Wind of God now blowing,\nYou are the seed that God is sowing.\nYou are the life that starts us growing:\nSpirit, now live in me.","O holy Rain of God now falling,\nYou make the Word of God enthralling,\nYou are that inner voice now calling:\nSpirit, now live in me.","O holy Flame of God now burning,\nYou are the power of Christ returning.\nYou are the answer to our yearning:\nSpirit, now live in me."],"chorus":""}
