{"number":415,"title":"415. Christ the Lord All Power Possessing","verses":["Christ, the Lord, all power possessing,\nParting, mounted heaven's height,\nGracious hands outstretched in blessing,\nClouds received Him from their sight.\nChrist ascended, Christ ascended,\nChrist ascended on the clouds.\r\nChrist ascended on the clouds.","Daniel views earth's judgment hour,\nAngels gathering open books.\nGod enthroned inflaming power\nFor His Son's arrival looks.\nChrist approaches, Christ approaches,\nChrist approaches on the clouds.\r\nChrist approaches on the clouds.","Revelation's word fulfilling,\nTrumpet, voices pierce the air.\nSaint and sinner fainting, thrilling,\nEvery eye behold Him there.\nChrist is coming, Christ is coming,\nChrist is coming on the clouds.\r\nChrist is coming on the clouds."],"chorus":""}
