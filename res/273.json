Lord, I Have Made Thy Word My Choice","verses":["Lord, I have made Thy word my choice,\nMy lasting heritage;\nThere shall my noblest pow'rs rejoice,\nMy warmest thoughts engage.","I'll read the histories of Thy love,\nAnd keep Thy laws in sight;\nWhile through Thy promises I rove,\nWith ever fresh delight.","In this broad land of wealth unknown,\nWhere springs of life arise,\nSeeds of immortal bliss are sown,\nAnd hidden glory lies.","The best relief that mourners have,\nIt makes our sorrows blest;\nOur fairest hope beyond the grave,\nAnd our eternal rest."],"chorus":""}
