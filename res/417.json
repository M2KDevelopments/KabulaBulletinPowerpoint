{"number":417,"title":"417. O Solemn Thought","verses":["O solemn thought and can it be\nThe hour of judgment now is come\nWhich soon must fix our destiny,\nAnd seal the sinner's fearful doom?\nYes, it is so; the judgment hour\r\nIs swiftly hastening to its close;\nThen will the Judge, in mighty power,\nDescend in vengeance on His foes.","He who came down to earth to die\nAn offering for the sins of men,\nAnd then ascended upon on high,\nAnd will e'er long return again,\nIs standing now before the ark,\nAnd mercy seat and cherubim,\nTo plead His blood for saints, and make\nThe last remembrance of their sin.","The solemn moment is at hand\nWhen we who have His name confessed,\nEach in his lot must singly stand\nAnd pass the final, searching test.\nJesus! we hope in Thee alone;\nIn mercy now upon us look,\nConfess our names before the throne,\nAnd blot our sins from out Thy book.","O blessed Savior! may we feel\nThe full importance of this hour.\nInspire our hearts with holy zeal,\nAnd aid us by Thy Spirit's power,\nThat we may in Thy strength be strong,\nAnd brave the conflict valiantly;\nThen, on Mount Zion, join the song,\nAnd swell the notes of victory."],"chorus":""}
