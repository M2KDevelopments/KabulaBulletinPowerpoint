I Gave My Life for Thee","verses":["I gave My life for thee,\nMy precious blood I shed,\nThat thou might'st ransomed be,\nAnd quickened from the dead;\nI gave, I gave My life for thee,\nWhat hast thou given for Me?\nI gave, I gave My life for thee,\nWhat hast thou given for Me?","My Father's house of light,\nMy glory circled throne,\nI left for earthly night,\nFor wanderings sad and lone;\nI left, I left it all for thee,\nHast thou left aught for Me?\nI left, I left it all for thee,\nHast thou left aught for Me?","I suffered much for thee,\nMore than thy tongue can tell,\nOf bitterest agony,\nTo rescue thee from hell;\nI've borne, I've borne it all for thee,\nWhat hast thou borne for Me?\nI've borne, I've borne it all for thee,\nWhat hast thou borne for Me?"],"chorus":""}
