{"number":370,"title":"370. Christ for the World","verses":["Christ for the world we sing;\nThe world to Christ we bring\nWith loving zeal;\nThe poor and them that mourn,\nThe faint and overborne,\nSin-sick and sorrow-worn,\nWhom Christ doth heal.","Christ for the world we sing;\nThe world to Christ we bring\nWith fervent prayer;\nThe wayward and the lost,\nBy restless passions tossed,\nRedeemed at countless cost\nFrom dark despair.","Christ for the world we sing;\nThe world to Christ we bring\nWith joyful song;\nThe newborn souls, whose days,\nReclaimed from error's ways,\nInspired with hope and praise,\nTo Christ belong."],"chorus":""}
