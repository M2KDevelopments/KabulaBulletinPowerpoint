{"number":464,"title":"464. When I Can Read My Title Clear","verses":["When I can read my title clear\nTo mansions in the skies\nI'll bid farewell to every fear,\nAnd wipe my weeping eyes;\nAnd wipe my weeping eyes,\nAnd wipe my weeping eyes,\nI'll bid farewell to every fear,\nAnd wipe my weeping eyes.","Should earth against my soul engage,\nAnd fiery darts be hurled,\nThen I can smile at Satan's rage,\nAnd face a frowning world;\nAnd face a frowning world,\nAnd face a frowning world,\nThen I can smile at Satan's rage,\nAnd face a frowning world.","Let cares like a wild deluge come,\nAnd storms or sorrow fall!\nMay I but safely reach my home,\nMay God, my heav’n, my all;\nMy God. my heav’n, my all,\nMy God, my heav’n, my all,\nMay I but safely reach my home,\nMy God, my heav’n, my all."],"chorus":""}
