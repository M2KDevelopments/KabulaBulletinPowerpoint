O, How I Love Jesus","verses":["There is a name I love to hear,\nI love to sing its worth;\nIt sounds like music in my ear,\nThe sweetest name on earth.","It tells me of a Savior's love,\nWho died to set me free;\nIt tells me of His precious blood,\nThe sinner's perfect plea.","It tells of One whose loving heart\nCan feel my deepest woe,\nWho in each sorrow bears a part\nThat none can bear below."],"chorus":"O, how I love Jesus,\nO, how I love Jesus,\nO, how I love Jesus\nBecause He first loved me!"}
