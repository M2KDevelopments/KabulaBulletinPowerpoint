Fairest Lord Jesus","verses":["Fairest Lord Jesus,\nRuler of all nature,\nO Thou of God and man the Son!\nThee will I cherish,\nThee will I honor,\nThou art my glory, joy, and crown.","Fair are the meadows,\nFairer still the woodlands,\nRobed in the blooming garb of spring;\nJesus is fairer,\nJesus is purer,\nWho makes the woeful heart to sing.","Fair is the sunshine,\nFairer still the moonlight,\nAnd all the twinkling, starry host;\nJesus shines brighter,\nJesus shines purer\nThan all the angels heaven can boast.","Beautiful Savior,\nLord of the nations,\nSon of God and Son of Man!\nGlory and honor,\nPraise, adoration,\nNow and forevermore be Thine!"],"chorus":""}
