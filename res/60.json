Blessed Jesus, at Thy Word","verses":["Blessed Jesus, at Thy word\nWe are gathered all to hear Thee;\nLet our hearts and souls be stirred\nNow to seek and love and fear Thee;\nBy Thy teachings sweet and holy,\nDrawn from earth to love Thee solely.","All our knowledge, sense, and sight\nLie in deepest darkness shrouded,\nTill Thy Spirit breaks our night\nWith the beams of truth unclouded.\nThou alone to God canst win us;\nThou must work all good within us.","Glorious Lord, Thyself impart!\nLight of light, from God proceeding,\nOpen Thou our ears and heart,\nHelp us by Thy Spirit's pleading,\nHear the cry Thy people raises,\nHear, and bless our prayers and praises."],"chorus":""}
