{"number":96,"title":"96. The Spacious Firmament","verses":["The spacious firmament on high,\nWith all the blue, ethereal sky,\nAnd spangled heavens, a shining frame,\nTheir great Original proclaim.\nTh'unwearied sun from day to day\nDoes his Creator's power display,\nAnd publishes to every land\nThe work of an almighty hand.","Soon as the evening shades prevail,\nThe moon takes up the wondrous tale;\nAnd nightly to the listening earth\nRepeats the story of her birth;\nWhile all the stars that round her burn,\nAnd all the planets in their turn,\nConfirm the tidings as they roll,\nAnd spread the truth from pole to pole.","What though in solemn silence all\nMove round the dark terrestrial ball?\nWhat though no real voice nor sound\nAmid their radiant orbs be found?\nIn reason's ear they all rejoice\nAnd utter forth a glorious voice,\nForever singing as they shine,\n\"The hand that made us is divine?\""],"chorus":""}
