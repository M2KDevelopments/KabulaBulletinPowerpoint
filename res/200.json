{"number":200,"title":"200. The Lord Is Coming","verses":["The Lord is coming, let this be\r\nThe herald note of jubilee;\nAnd when we meet and when we part\nThe salutation from the heart.","The Lord is coming! sound it forth\nFrom east to west, from south to north;\nSpeed on! speed on the tidings glad,\nThat none who love Him may be sad.","The Lord is coming, swift and sure\nAnd all His judgments shall endure,\nAnd none can hope to escape\nHis wrath, Who walk not in the narrow path.","This earth, with her ten thousand wrongs\nWill soon be tuned to nobler songs;\nOur praise shall then, in realms of light,\nWith all His universe unite."],"chorus":"The Lord is coming, let this be\r\nThe herald note of jubilee,\nThe herald note of jubilee."}
