{"number":318,"title":"318. Whiter Than Snow","verses":["Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;\nI want Thee forever to live in my soul;\nBreak down every idol, cast out every foe;\nNow wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.","Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,\nAnd help me to make a complete sacrifice;\nI give up myself, and whatever I know,\nNow wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.","Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;\nI wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet,\nBy faith, for my cleansing; I see Thy blood flow,\nNow wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.","Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;\nCome now, and within me a new heart create;\nTo those who have sought Thee, Thou never said'st No;\nNow wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."],"chorus":"Whiter than snow, yes whiter than snow;\nNow wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."}
