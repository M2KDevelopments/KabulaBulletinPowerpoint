Dear Lord We Come At Set of Sun","verses":["Dear Lord, we come at set of sun,\nAnd at Your feet we kneel\nTo worship You, Creator, King,\nThis day, Your sign and seal.","Our earthly tasks we lay aside,\nAccording to Your Word,\nTo enter now Your holy rest,\nThe Sabbath of the Lord.","Sweet Sabbath rest, your sacred hours\nAre as a golden chain\nThat reaches back to Eden's gate\nAnd points us home again.","And when this earth shall be renewed,\nAnd sin and death destroyed,\nShall all redeemed each Sabbath day\nStill meet to praise their God."],"chorus":""}
