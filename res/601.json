Watchmen, on the Walls of Zion","verses":["Watchmen, on the walls of Zion,\nWhat, O tell us, of the night?\nIs the day-star now arising?\nWill the morn soon greet our sight?\nO'er your vision\nShine there now some rays of light?\nO'er your vision\nShine there now some rays of light?","Tell, O tell us, are the landmarks\nOn our voyage all passed by?\nAre we nearing now the haven?\nCan we e'en the land descry?\nDo we truly\nSee the heavenly kingdom nigh?\nDo we truly\nSee the heavenly kingdom nigh?","Light is beaming, day is coming!\nLet us sound aloud the cry;\nWe behold the day-star rising\nPure and bright in yonder sky!\nSaints, be joyful;\nYour redemption draweth nigh;\nSaints, be joyful;\nYour redemption draweth nigh.","We have found the chart and compass,\nAnd are sure the land is near;\nOnward, onward we are hasting,\nSoon the haven will appear;\nLet your voices\nSound aloud our holy cheer;\nLet your voices\nSound aloud your holy cheer."],"chorus":""}
