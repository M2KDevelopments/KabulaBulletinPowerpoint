More Love to Thee","verses":["More love to Thee, O Christ!\nMore love to Thee;\nHear Thou the prayer I make\nOn bended knee.\nThis is my earnest plea,\nMore love, O Christ, to Thee,\nMore love to Thee!\nMore love to Thee!","Once earthly joy I craved,\nSought peace and rest;\nNow Thee alone I seek,\nGive what is best.\nThis all my prayer shall be,\nMore love, O Christ, to Thee,\nMore love to Thee!\nMore love to Thee!","Let sorrow do its work,\nSend grief or pain;\nSweet are Thy messengers,\nSweet their refrain,\nWhen they can sing with me,\nMore love, O Christ, to Thee,\nMore love to Thee!\nMore love to Thee!","Then shall my latest breath\nWhisper Thy praise;\nThis be the parting cry\nMy heart shall raise,\nThis still its prayer shall be:\nMore love, O Christ, to Thee,\nMore love to Thee!\nMore love to Thee!"],"chorus":""}
