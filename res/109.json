{"number":109,"title":"109. Marvelous Grace","verses":["Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,\nGrace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!\nYonder on Calvary's mount outpoured\nThere where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.","Sin and despair, like the seawaves cold,\nThreaten the soul with infinite loss;\nGrace that is greater; yes, grace untold;\nPoints to the Refuge, the mighty Cross.","Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,\nFreely bestowed on all who believe!\nYou that are longing to see His face,\nWill you this moment His grace receive?"],"chorus":"Grace, grace, God's grace,\nGrace that will pardon and cleanse within;\nGrace, grace, God's grace,\nGrace that is greater than all our sin!"}
