Only Trust Him","verses":["Come, every soul by sin oppressed,\nThere's mercy with the Lord,\nAnd He will surely give you rest,\nBy trusting in His word.","For Jesus shed His precious blood\nRich blessings to bestow;\nPlunge now into the crimson flood\nThat washes white as snow.","Yes, Jesus is the truth, the way,\nThat leads you into rest;\nBelieve in Him without delay,\nAnd you are fully blest.","Come, then, and join this holy band,\nAnd on to glory go,\nTo dwell in that celestial land,\nWhere joys immortal flow."],"chorus":"Only trust Him, only trust Him,\nOnly trust Him now;\nHe will save you, He will save you,\nHe will save you now."}
