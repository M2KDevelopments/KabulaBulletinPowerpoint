{"number":656,"title":"656. O Perfect Love","verses":["O perfect Love, all human thought transcending,\nLowly we kneel in prayer before Thy throne,\nThat theirs may be the love that has no ending,\nWhom Thou forevermore dost join in one.","O perfect Life, be Thou their full assurance,\nOf tender charity and steadfast faith,\nOf patient hope, and quiet, brave endurance,\nWith child-like trust that fears nor pain nor death.","Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow;\nGrant them the peace which calms all earthly strife,\nAdd to life's day the glorious unknown morrow\nThat dawns upon eternal love and life."],"chorus":""}
