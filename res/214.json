We Have This Hope","verses":["We have this hope that burns within our hearts,\nHope in the coming of the Lord.\nWe have this faith that Christ alone imparts,\nFaith in the promise of His Word.\nWe believe the time is here,\nWhen the nations far and near\nShall awake, and shout, and sing\r\nHallelujah! Christ is King!\nWe have this hope that burns within our hearts,\nHope in the coming of the Lord.","We are united in Jesus Christ our Lord.\nWe are united in His love.\nLove for the waiting people of the world.\nPeople who need our Savior's love.\nSoon the hean'ns will open wide,\r\nChrist will come to claim His bride.\nAll the universe will sing Hallelujah!\nChrist is King! We have this hope,\r\nthis faith, and God's great love\nWe are united in Christ"],"chorus":""}
