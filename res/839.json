{"title":"839. Spiritual Wisdom - 1 Corinthians 2  ","number":839,"verses":["We speak wisdom among those who are mature,\nyet not the wisdom of this age,\nnor of the rulers of this age,\nwho are coming to nothing.","But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,\nthe hidden wisdom which God ordained\nbefore the ages for our glory,\nwhich none of the rulers of this age knew;\nfor had they known,\nthey would not have crucified the Lord of glory.","But as it is written:\n\"Eye has not seen, nor ear heard,\nNor have entered into the heart of man\nThe things which God has prepared\nfor those who love Him.\"","But God has revealed them to us\nthrough His Spirit.\nFor the Spirit searches all things,\nyes, the deep things of God.","For what man knows the things of a man\nexcept the spirit of the man which is in him?\nEven so no one knows the things of God\nexcept the Spirit of God.","Now we have received,\nnot the spirit of the world,\nbut the Spirit who is from God,\nthat we might know the things\nthat have been freely given to us by God.","These things we also speak,\nnot in words which man's wisdom\nteaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches,\ncomparing spiritual things with spiritual.","But the natural man does not receive\nthe things of the Spirit of God,\nfor they are foolishness to him;\nnor can he know them,\nbecause they are spiritually discerned.","But he who is spiritual judges all things,\nyet he himself is rightly judged by no one.\nFor \"Who has known the mind of the\nLord that he may instruct Him?\"","But we have the mind of Christ."]}
