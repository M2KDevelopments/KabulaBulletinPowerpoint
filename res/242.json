{"number":242,"title":"242. Jesus, Thou Joy of Loving Hearts","verses":["Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts!\nThou fount of life! Thou light of men!\nFrom the best bliss that earth imparts,\nWe turn unfilled to Thee again.","Thy truth unchanged has ever stood;\nThou savest those that on Thee call;\nTo them that seek Thee Thou art good,\nTo them that find Thee, all in all.","We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,\nAnd long to feast upon Thee still;\nWe drink of Thee, the Fountainhead,\nAnd thirst our souls from Thee to fill!","Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,\nWheree'er our changeful lot is cast;\nGlad, when Thy gracious smile we see,\nBlest, when our faith can hold Thee fast.","O Jesus, ever with us stay;\nMake all our moments calm and bright;\nChase the dark night of sin a way,\nShed o'er the world Thy holy light!"],"chorus":""}
