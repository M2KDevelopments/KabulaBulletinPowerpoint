{"number":453,"title":"453. We Have Heard","verses":["We have heard from the bright, the holy, land;\nWe have heard, and our hearts are glad;\nFor we were a lonely pilgrim band,\nAnd weary, and worn, and sad.\nThey tell us the saints have a dwelling there;\nNo longer are homeless ones;\nAnd we know that the goodly land is fair,\nWhere life's pure river runs.","They say green fields are waving there,\nThat never a blight shall know;\nAnd the deserts wild are blooming fair,\nAnd the roses of Sharon grow.\nThere are lovely birds in the bowers green,\nTheir songs are blithe and sweet;\nAnd their warblings, gushing ever new,\nThe angels' harpings greet.","We have heard of the palms, the robes, the crowns,\nAnd the silvery band in white;\nOf the city fair, with pearly gates,\nAll radiant with light.\nWe have heard of the angels there, and saints,\nWith their harps of gold, how they sing;\nOf the mount with the fruitful tree of life,\nOf the leaves that healing bring.","The King of that country, He is fair,\nHe's the joy and light of the place;\nIn His beauty we shall behold Him there,\nAnd bask in His smiling face.\nWe'll be there, we'll be there in a little while,\nWe'll join the pure and the blest;\nWe'll have the palm, the robe, the crown,\nAnd forever be at rest."],"chorus":""}
