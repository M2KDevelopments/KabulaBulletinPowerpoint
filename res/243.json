{"number":243,"title":"243. King of Glory, King of Peace","verses":["King of glory, King of peace,\nI will love Thee;\nAnd that love may never cease,\nI will move Thee.\nThou hast granted my request,\nThou hast heard me;\nThou didst note my working breast,\nThou hast spared me.","Wherefore with my utmost art\nI will sing Thee,\nAnd the cream of all my heart\nI will bring Thee.\nThough my sins against me cried,\nThou didst clear me;\nAnd alone, when they replied,\nThou didst hear me.","Seven whole days, not one in seven,\nI will praise Thee;\nIn my heart, though not in heav'n,\nI can raise Thee.\nSmall it is, in this poor sort\nTo enroll Thee:\nEv'n eternity's too short\nTo extol Thee."],"chorus":""}
