{"title":"765. Conversion - Ephesians 2  ","number":765,"verses":["Time was when you were dead in\nyour sins and wickedness,\nwhen you followed the evil ways\nof this present age,\nwhen you obeyed the commander of\nthe spiritual powers of the air,\nthe spirit now at work among God's rebel subjects.\n    ","We too were once of their number: we all\nlived our lives in sensuality,\nand obeyed the promptings of our\nown instincts and notions.\n    ","In our natural condition we, like the rest,\nlay under the dreadful judgement of God.\nBut God, rich in mercy,\nfor the great love he bore us,\nbrought us to life with Christ\neven when we were dead in our sins;\nit is by his grace you are saved.\n    ","And in union with Christ Jesus he raised us up\nand enthroned us with him in the heavenly realms,\nso that he might display in the ages to come\nhow immense are the resources of his grace,\nand how great his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.\n    ","For it is by his grace you are saved,\nthrough trusting him;\nit is not your own doing.\nIt is God's gift,\nnot a reward for work done.\nThere is nothing for anyone to boast of.\nFor we are God's handiwork,\ncreated in Christ Jesus to devote ourselves\nto the good deeds for which God has designed us.\n    "]}
