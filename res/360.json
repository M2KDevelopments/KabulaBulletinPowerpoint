{"number":360,"title":"360. From the Eastern Mountains","verses":["From the eastern mountains\nPressing on they come,\nWise men in their wisdom,\nTo His humble home;\nStirred by deep devotion,\nHasting from afar,\nEver journeying onward,\nGuided by a star.","There their Lord and Savior\nMeek and lowly lay,\nWondrous light that led them\nOnward on their way,\nEver now to lighten\nNations from afar,\nAs they journey homeward\nBy that guiding star.","Gather in the outcasts\nAll who've gone astray,\nThrow Thy radiance o'er them,\nGuide them on their way;\nThose who never knew Thee,\nThose who've wandered far,\nGuide them by the brightness\nOf Thy guiding star.","Until every nation,\nWhether bond or free,\n'Neath Thy starlit banner,\nJesus follows thee.\nO'er the distant mountains\nTo that heavenly home,\nWhere no sin nor sorrow\nEvermore shall come."],"chorus":""}
