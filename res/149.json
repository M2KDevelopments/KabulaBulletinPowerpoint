Once in Royal David's City","verses":["Once in royal David's city\nStood a lowly cattle shed,\nWhere a mother laid her Baby\nIn a manger for His bed;\nMary was that mother mild,\nJesus Christ her little Child.","He came down to earth from heaven\nWho is God and Lord of all,\nAnd His shelter was a stable,\nAnd His cradle was a stall;\nWith the poor, and mean, and lowly,\nLived on earth our Savior holy.","And through all His wondrous childhood\nHe would honor and obey,\nLove and watch the lowly mother\nIn whose gentle arms He lay.\nChristian children all must be\nMild, obedient, good as He.","And our eyes at last shall see Him,\nThrough His own redeeming love;\nFor that Child so dear and gentle\nIs our Lord in heaven above;\nAnd He leads His children on\nTo the place where He is gone."],"chorus":""}
