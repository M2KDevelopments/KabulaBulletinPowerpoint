More About Jesus","verses":["More about Jesus I would know,\nMore of His grace to others show;\nMore of His saving fullness see,\nMore of His love who died for me.","More about Jesus let me learn,\nMore of His holy will discern;\nSpirit of God, my teacher be,\nShowing the things of Christ to me.","More about Jesus; in His word,\nHolding communion with my Lord,\nHearing His voice in every line,\nMaking each faithful saying mine.","More about Jesus; on His throne,\nRiches in glory all His own;\nMore of His kingdom's sure increase;\nMore of His coming, Prince of Peace."],"chorus":"More, more about Jesus,\nMore, more about Jesus;\nMore of His saving fullness see,\nMore of His love who died for me."}
