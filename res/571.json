What Does the Lord Require","verses":["What does the Lord require for praise and offering?\nWhat sacrifice, desire or tribute bid you bring?\nDo justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.","Rulers of men, give ear! Should you not justice show?\nWill God your pleading hear, while crime and cruelty grow?\nDo justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.","How shall our life fulfill God's law so hard and high?\nLet Christ endue our will with grace to fortify.\nThen justly, in mercy we'll humbly walk with God."],"chorus":""}
