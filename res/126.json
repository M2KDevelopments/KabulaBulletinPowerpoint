{"number":126,"title":"126. In the Bleak Midwinter","verses":["In the bleak midwinter\nFrosty wind made moan;\nEarth stood hard as iron,\nWater like a stone;\nSnow had fallen, snow on snow,\nSnow on snow,\nIn the bleak minwinter,\nLong ago.","Angels and archangels\nMay have gathered there,\nCherubim and seraphim\nThronged the air.\nBut His mother only\nIn her maiden bliss,\nWorshiped the beloved\nWith a kiss.","What can I give Him,\nPoor as I am?\nIf I were a shepherd\nI would bring a lamb;\nIf I were a wise man\nI would do my part;\nYet what can I give Him?\nGive my heart."],"chorus":""}
