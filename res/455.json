{"number":455,"title":"455. Immortal Love, Forever Full","verses":["Immortal Love, forever full,\nForever flowing free,\nForever shared, forever whole,\nA never ebbing sea!","We may not climb the heavenly steeps\nTo bring the Lord Christ down;\nIn vain we search the lowest deeps,\nFor Him no depths can drown.","But warm, sweet, tender, even yet\nA present help is He;\nAnd faith has still its Olivet,\nAnd love its Galilee.","The healing of His seamless dress\nIs by our beds of pain;\nWe touch Him in life's throng and press,\nAnd we are whole again.","Through Him the first fond prayers are said,\nOur lips of childhood frame;\nThe last low whispers of our dead\nAre burdened with His name.","O Lord and Master of us all:\nWhat e'er our name or sign,\nWe own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,\nWe test our lives by Thine!"],"chorus":""}
