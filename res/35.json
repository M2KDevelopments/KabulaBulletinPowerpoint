{"number":35,"title":"35. With Songs and Honors","verses":["With songs and honors sounding loud,\nAddress the Lord on high;\nOver the heavens He spreads His cloud,\nAnd waters veil the sky.","He sends His showers of blessing down\nTo cheer the plains below;\nHe makes the grass the mountains crown,\nAnd corn in valleys grow.","His steady counsels change the face\nOf the declining year;\nHe bids the sun cut short his race,\nAnd wintry days appear.","He sends His word, and melts the snow;\nThe fields no longer mourn;\nHe calls the warmer gales to blow,\nAnd bids the spring return.","The changing wind, the flying cloud,\nObey His mighty word:\nWith songs and honors sounding loud\nPraise ye the sovereign Lord!"],"chorus":""}
