Make Me a Captive, Lord","verses":["Make me a captive, Lord,\nAnd then I shall be free;\nForce me to render up my sword,\nAnd I shall conqueror be.\nI sink in life's alarms\nWhen by myself I stand;\nImprison me within Thine arms,\nAnd strong shall be my hand.","My heart is weak and poor\nTill it a master find;\nIt has no spring of action sure;\nIt varies with the wind.\nIt cannot freely move\nTill Thou hast wrought its chain;\nEnslave it with Thy matchless love,\nAnd deathless it shall reign.","My will is not my own\nTill Thou hast made it Thine;\nIf it would reach a monarch's throne\nIt must its crown resign;\nIt only stands unbent,\nAmid the clashing strife,\nWhen on Thy bosom it has leant\nAnd found in Thee its life."],"chorus":""}
