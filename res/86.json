{"number":86,"title":"86. How Great Thou Art","verses":["O Lord my God! when I in awesome wonder\nConsider all the works Thy hands have made,\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\nThy pow'r thro'out the universe displayed,","When thro'the woods and forest glades I wander\nAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;\nWhen I look down from lofty mountain grandeur\nAnd hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze;","And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,\nSent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;\nThat on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,\nHe bled and died to take away my sin;","When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation\nAnd take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!\nThen I shall bow in humble adoration\nAnd there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!"],"chorus":"Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee;\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee;\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!"}
