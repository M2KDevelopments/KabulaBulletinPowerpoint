O When Shall I See Jesus","verses":["O, when shall I see Jesus and reign with Him above,\nAnd shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning?\nAnd from the flowing fountain drink everlasting love,\nAnd shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning.","Gird on the gospel armor of faith and hope and love,\nAnd you'll hear the trumpet sound in that morning.\nAnd when the combat's ended He'll carry you above,\nAnd you'll hear the trumpet sound in that morning.","Our ears shall hear with transport the host of heaven sing,\nAnd shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning.\nOur tongues shall chant the glories of our immortal King.\nAnd shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning,"],"chorus":"O, shout, glory!\nFor I shall mount above the skies,\nWhen I hear the trumpet sound in that morning."}
