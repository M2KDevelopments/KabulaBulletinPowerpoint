{"number":523,"title":"523. My Faith Has Found a Resting Place","verses":["My faith has found a resting place,\nNot in a manmade creed;\nI trust the ever living One,\nThat He for me will plead.","Enough for me that Jesus saves,\nThis ends my fear and doubt;\nA sinful soul I come to Him,\nHe will not cast me out.","My soul is resting on the Word,\nThe living Word of God:\nSalvation in my Savior's name,\nSalvation through His blood.","The great Physician heals the sick,\nThe lost He came to save;\nFor me His precious blood He shed,\nFor me His life He gave."],"chorus":"I need no other evidence,\nI need no other plea;\nIt is enough that Jesus died\nAnd rose again for me."}
