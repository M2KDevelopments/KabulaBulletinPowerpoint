{"number":313,"title":"313. Just as I Am","verses":["Just as I am, without one plea,\nBut that Thy blood was shed for me,\nAnd that Thou bid'st me come to Thee,\nO Lamb of God, I come.","Just as I am, and waiting not\nTo rid my soul of one dark blot,\nTo Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,\nO Lamb of God, I come.","Just as I am, though tossed about\nWith many conflict, many a doubt;\n\"Fightings within, and fears without,\"\nO Lamb of God, I come.","Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;\nSight, riches, healing of the mind,\nYea, all I need, in Thee I find,\nO Lamb of God, I come.","Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,\nWilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;\nBecause Thy promise I believe,\nO Lamb of God, I come.","Just as I am, Thy love I own\nHas broken every barrier down;\nNow to be Thine, and Thine alone,\nO Lamb of God, I come."],"chorus":""}
