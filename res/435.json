{"number":435,"title":"435. The Glory Song","verses":["When all my labors and trials are o'er,\nAnd I am safe on that beautiful shore,\nJust to be near the dear Lord I adore,\nWill through the ages be glory for me.","When, by the gift of His infinite grace,\nI am accorded in heaven a place,\nJust to be there and to look on His face,\nWill through the ages be glory for me.","Friends will be there I have loved long ago;\nJoy like a river around me will flow,\nYet, just a smile from my Savior, I know,\nWill through the ages be glory for me."],"chorus":"O that will be glory for me,\nGlory for me, glory for me;\nWhen by His grace I shall look on His face,\nThat will be glory, be glory for me."}
