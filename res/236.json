I Love Thee","verses":["I love Thee, I love Thee, I love Thee, my Lord;\nI love Thee, my Savior, I love Thee, my God.\nI love Thee, I love Thee, and that Thou dost know;\nBut how much I love Thee my actions will show.","I'm happy, I'm happy, O, wondrous account!\nMy joys are immortal, I stand on the mount!\nI gaze on my treasure and long to be there,\nWith Jesus and angels, and kindred so dear.","O Jesus, my Savior, with Thee I am blest,\nMy life and salvation, my joy and my rest:\nThy name be my theme, and Thy love be my song;\nThy grace shall inspire both my heart and my tongue.","O, who's like my Savior? He's Salem's bright King;\nHe smiles, and He loves me, and helps me to sing.\nI'll praise Him, I'll praise Him, with notes loud and clear,\nWhile rivers of pleasure my spirit do cheer."],"chorus":""}
