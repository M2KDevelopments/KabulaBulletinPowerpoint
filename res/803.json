{"title":"803. Praise is Rightfully Yours - Psalm 65  ","number":803,"verses":["Praise is rightfully yours, God, in Zion.\nVows to you must be fulfilled,\nfor you answer prayer.\n    ","All flesh must come to you with all its sins;\nthough our faults overpower us,\nyou blot them out.\n    ","Happy the man you choose, whom\nyou invite to live in your courts.\nFill us with the good things of your house,\nof your holy Temple.\n    ","Your righteousness repays us with marvels,\nGod our saviour, hope of all the ends of\nthe earth and the distant islands.\n    ","Your strength holds the mountains up,\nsuch is the power that wraps you;\nyou calm the clamour of the ocean,\nthe clamour of its waves.\n    ","The nations are un uproar,\nin panic those who live at the ends of the world,\nas your miracles bring shouts of joy\nto the portals of morning and evening.\n    ","You visit the earth and water it,\nyou load it with riches;\nGod's rivers brim with water\nto provide their grain.\n    ","This is how you provide it:\nby drenching its furrows,\nby levelling its ridges,\nby softening it with showers,\nby blessing the first-fruits.\n    ","You crown the year with your bounty,\nabundance flows wherever you pass;\nthe desert pastures overflow,\nthe hillsides are wrapped in joy,\nthe meadows are dressed in flocks,\nthe valleys are clothed in wheat,\nwhat shouts of joy, what singing!\n    "]}
