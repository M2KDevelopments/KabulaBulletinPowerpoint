Father, Lead Me Day by Day","verses":["Father, lead me day by day,\nEver in Thine own sweet way;\nTeach me to be pure and true;\nShow me what I ought to do.","When in danger, make me brave;\nMake me know that Thou canst save;\nKeep me safe by Thy dear side;\nLet me in Thy love abide.","When I'm tempted to do wrong,\nMake me steadfast, wise, and strong;\nAnd when all alone I stand,\nShield me with Thy mighty hand.","May I do the good I know,\nBe Thy loving child below,\nThen at last go home to Thee,\nEvermore Thy child to be."],"chorus":""}
