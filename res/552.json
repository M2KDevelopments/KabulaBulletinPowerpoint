The Lord's My Shepherd","verses":["The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;\nHe makes me down to lie\nIn pastures green; He leadeth me\nThe quiet waters by.","My soul He doth restore again.\nAnd me to walk doth make\nWithin the paths of righteousness,\nE'en for His own name's sake.","Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,\nYet will I fear no ill,\nFor Thou art with me, and Thy rod\nAnd staff me comfort still.","My table Thou hast furnished\nIn presence of my foes;\nMy head Thou dost with oil anoint,\nAnd my cup overflows.","Goodness and mercy all my life\nShall surely follow me;\nAnd in God's house forevermore\nMy dwelling place shall be."],"chorus":""}
