Angels We Have Heard On High","verses":["Angels we have heard on high,\nSinging sweetly through the night,\nAnd the mountains in reply\nEchoing their brave delight.","Shepherds, why this jubilee?\nWhy these songs of happy cheer?\nWhat great brightness did you see?\nWhat glad tidings did you hear?","Come to Bethlehem and see\nHim whose birth the angels sing;\nCome, adore on bended knee\nChrist, the Lord, the newborn King.","See Him in a manger laid\nWhom the angels praise above;\nMary, Joseph, lend your aid,\nWhile we raise our hearts in love."],"chorus":"Gloria in excelsis Deo,\nGloria in excelsis Deo."}
