Fight the Good Fight","verses":["Fight the good fight with all thy might,\nChrist is thy strength and Christ thy right;\nLay hold on life and it shall be\nThy joy and crown eternally.","Run the straight race through God's good grace;\nLift up thine eyes, and seek His face.\nLife with its path before us lies;\nChrist is the way, and Christ the prize.","Cast care aside, lean on thy guide;\nHis boundless mercy will provide;\nTrust, and the trusting soul shall prove\nChrist is its life, and Christ its love.","Faint not, nor fear, His arms are near;\nHe changeth not and thou art dear.\nOnly believe, and thou shalt see\nThat Christ is all in all to thee."],"chorus":""}
