{"number":253,"title":"253. There's No Other Name Like Jesus","verses":["There's no other name like Jesus,\n'Tis the dearest name we know,\n'Tis the angel's joy in Heaven,\n'Tis the Christian's joy below.","There's no other name like Jesus\nWhen the heart with grief is sad,\nThere's no other name like Jesus\nWhen the heart is free and glad.","'Tis the hope that I shall see Him\nWhen in glory He appears,\n'Tis the hope to hear His welcome\nThat my fainting spirit cheers.","If He wills that I should labor\nIn His vineyard day by day,\nThen 'tis well if only Jesus\nBlesses all I do or say.","If He wills that death's cold finger\nTouch my feeble, mortal clay,\nThen 'tis well if only Jesus\nIs my dying trust and stay."],"chorus":"Sweet name, dear name,\nThere's no other name like Jesus;\nSweet name, dear name,\nThere's no other name like Jesus."}
