{"number":81,"title":"81. Though I Speak With Tongues","verses":["Though I speak with tongues of men and angels,\nThough I have the prophet's gift,\nThough I hold the keys to hidden knowledge,\nThough my faith can mountains shift:\nWithout love I am no better,\nWithout love it's all for naught;\nLord, You spent Your life in loving others:\nWhat this means I would be taught.","Love is patient, knows no envy,\nNever gloats when others sin;\nLove is never glad to see injustice,\nAlways wants the truth to win.\nThere's no end to love's endurance,\nThere's no test it cannot face;\nLord, You spent Your life in loving others:\nI shall fail without Your grace.","Though there'll be an end to hidden knowledge,\nVisions, raptures, prophecy:\nFaith and hope and love shall last forever,\nLove the greatest of the three.\nWithout love I am no better,\nWithout love it's all for naught;\nLord, You gave Your life in saving others:\nWhat this means I would be taught."],"chorus":""}
