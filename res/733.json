{"title":"733. Christ's Sufferings and Death - I - Isaiah 53  ","number":733,"verses":["Who has believed our message,\nand to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\n    ","He grew up before him like a tender shoot,\nand like a root out of dry ground.\nHe had no beauty or majesty\nto attract us to him,\nnothing in his appearance\nthat we should desire him.\n    ","He was despised and rejected by men,\na man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.\nLike one from whom men hide their faces\nhe was despised, and we esteemed him not.\n    ","Surely he took up our infirmities\nand carried our sorrows,\nyet we considered him stricken by God,\nsmitten by him, and afflicted.\n    ","But he was pierced for our transgressions,\nhe was crushed for our iniquities;\nthe punishment that brought us peace was upon him,\nand by his wounds we are healed.\n    ","We all, like sheep, have gone astray,\neach of us has turned to his own way;\nand the Lord has laid on him\nthe iniquity of us all.\n    ","He was oppressed and afflicted,\nyet he did not open his mouth;\nhe was led like a lamb to the slaughter,\nand as a sheep before her shearers is silent,\nso he did not open his mouth.\n    ","By oppression and judgment, he was taken away.\nAnd who can speak of his descendants?\nFor he was cut off from the land of the living;\nfor the transgression of my people he was stricken.\n    ","He was assigned a grave with the wicked,\nand with the rich in his death,\nthough he had done no violence,\nnor was any deceit in his mouth.\n    ","Yet it was the Lord's will to crush\nhim and cause him to suffer,\nand though the Lord makes his life a guilt offering,\nhe will see his offspring and prolong his days,\nand the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.\n    ","After the suffering of his soul,\nhe will see the light of life and be satisfied;\nby his knowledge my righteous servant\r\nwill justify many,\nand he will bear their iniquities.\n    ","Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,\nand he will divide the spoils with the strong,\nbecause he poured out his life unto death,\nand was numbered with the transgressors.\nFor he bore the sin of many,\nand made intercession for the transgressors.\n    "]}
