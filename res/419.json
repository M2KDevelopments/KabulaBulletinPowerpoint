Soon Shall the Trump of God","verses":["Soon shall the trump of God\nGive out the welcome sound,\nThat shakes death's silent chamber walls,\nAnd breaks the turf sealed ground.","You dwellers in the dust,\nAwake, come forth, and sing;\nSharp has your frost of winter been,\nBut bright shall be your spring.","'Twas sown in weakness here;\n'Twill then be raised in power;\nThat which was sown in earthly seed\nShall rise a heav'nly flower."],"chorus":""}
