{"number":330,"title":"330. Take My Life and Let It Be","verses":["Take my life, and let it be\nConsecrated, Lord, to Thee;\nTake my hands, and let them move\nAt the impulse of Thy love,\nAt the impulse of Thy love.","Take my feet, and let them be\nSwift and beautiful for Thee;\nTake my voice, and let me sing\nAlways, only, for my King,\nAlways, only, for my King.","Take my lips, and let them be\nFilled with messages from Thee;\nTake my silver and my gold,\nNot a mite would I withhold,\nNot a mite would I withhold.","Take my will and make it Thine;\nIt shall be no longer mine;\nTake my heart, it is Thine own!\nIt shall be Thy royal throne,\nIt shall be Thy royal throne.","Take my love; my Lord, I pour\nAt Thy feet its treasure store;\nTake myself, and I will be,\nEver, only, all for Thee,\nEver, only; all for Thee."],"chorus":""}
