{"number":607,"title":"607. God of Grace and God of Glory","verses":["God of grace and God of glory,\nOn Thy people pour Thy power;\nNow fulfill Thy church's story,\nBring her bud to glorious flower.\nGrant us wisdom, grant us courage,\nFor the facing of this hour.","Lo, the hosts of evil round us\r\nScorn Thy Christ, assail His ways;\nFrom the fears that long have bound us\nFree our hearts to faith and praise.\nGrant us wisdom, grant us courage,\nFor the facing of this hour.","Cure Thy children's warring madness,\nBend our pride to Thy control;\nShame our wanton, selfish gladness\nRich in goods and poor in soul.\nGrant us wisdom, grant us courage,\nLest we miss Thy kingdom's goal.","Set our feet on lofty places,\nGird our lives that they may be\nArmored with all Christ like graces\nIn the fight to set all free.\nGrant us wisdom, grant us courage,\nThat we fail not man nor Thee."],"chorus":""}
