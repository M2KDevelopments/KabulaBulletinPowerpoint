Jesus, With Thy Church Abide","verses":["Jesus, with Thy church abide;\nBe her Savior, Lord, and Guide,\nWhile on earth her faith is tried:\nWe beseech Thee, hear us.","May her voice be ever clear,\nWarning of a judgment near,\nTelling of a Savior dear:\nWe beseech Thee, hear us.","May she guide the poor and blind,\nSeek the lost until she find,\nAnd the broken-hearted bind:\nWe beseech Thee, hear us.","May she holy triumphs win,\nOverthrow the hosts of sin,\nGather all the nations in:\nWe beseech Thee, hear us."],"chorus":""}
