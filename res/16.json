{"number":16,"title":"16. All People That on Earth Do Dwell","verses":["All people that on earth do dwell,\nSing to the Lord with cheerful voice;\nHim serve with mirth, His praise forth tell,\nCome ye before Him and rejoice.","Know that the Lord is God indeed;\nWithout our aid He did us make;\nWe are His folk, He doth us feed,\nAnd for His sheep He doth us take.","O enter then His gates with praise,\nApproach with joy His courts unto;\nPraise, laud, and bless His name always,\nFor it is seemly so to do.","For why the Lord our God is good,\nHis mercy is forever sure;\nHis truth at all times firmly stood,\nAnd shall from age to age endure."],"chorus":""}
