Jesus Invites His Saints","verses":["Jesus invites His saints\nTo meet around His board,\nAnd sup in memory of the death\nAnd sufferings of their Lord.","We take the bread and wine\nAs emblems of Thy death;\nLord, raise our souls above the sign,\nTo feast on Thee by faith.","Faith eats the bread of life,\nAnd drinks the living wine;\nIt looks beyond this scene of strife;\nUnites us to the Vine.","Soon shall the night be gone,\nOur Lord will come again;\nThe marriage supper of the Lamb\nWill usher in His reign."],"chorus":""}
