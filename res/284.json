For You I Am Praying","verses":["I have a Savior, He's pleading in glory,\nA dear, loving Savior, though earth friends be few;\nAnd now He is watching in tenderness o'er me,\nBut oh that my Savior were your Savior, too.","I have a Father; to me He has given\nA hope for eternity, blessed and true;\nAnd soon He will call me to meet Him in heaven,\nBut oh that He'd let me bring you with me, too!","I have a robe; 'tis resplendent in whiteness,\nAwaiting in glory my wondering view;\nOh, when I receive it, all shining in brightness,\nDear friend, could I see you receiving one, you!","When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,\nThat my loving Savior is your Savior, too;\nThen pray that your Savior will bring them to glory,\nAnd prayer will be answered; 'twas answered for you!"],"chorus":"For you I am praying,\nFor you I am praying,\nFor you I am praying,\nI'm praying for you."}
