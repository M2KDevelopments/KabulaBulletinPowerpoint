Dear Savior, draw nigh.\nWe humbly beseech Thee, Lord Jesus, we pray,\nWith love and the Spirit baptize us today.","Unworthy we cry, Unholy, unclean,\nO wash us and cleanse us From sin's guilty stain.\nWe humbly beseech Thee, Lord Jesus, we pray,\nWith love and the Spirit baptize us today.","O heavenly Dove, Descend from on high!\nWe plead Thy rich blessing; In mercy draw nigh.\nWe humbly beseech Thee, Lord Jesus, we pray,\nWith love and the Spirit baptize us today.","O list the glad voice! From heaven it came:\nThou art My beloved, Well pleased I am.\nWe praise Thee, we bless Thee, dear Lamb that was slain,\nWe laud and adore Thee, Amen and Amen."],"chorus":""}
