{"number":163,"title":"163. At the Cross","verses":["Alas, and did my Savior bleed?\nAnd did my Sovereign die?\nWould He devote that sacred head\nFor someone such as I?","Was it for crimes that I have done,\nHe suffered on the tree?\nAmazing pity! grace unknown!\nAnd love beyond degree!","But drops of grief can ne'er repay\nThe debt of love I owe:\nHere, Lord, I give myself away,\n'Tis all that I can do!"],"chorus":"At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,\nAnd the burden of my heart rolled away,\nIt was there by faith I received my sight,\nAnd now I am happy all the day!"}
