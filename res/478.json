{"number":478,"title":"478. Sweet Hour of Prayer","verses":["Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,\nThat calls me from a world of care,\nAnd bids me, at my Father's throne,\nMake all my wants and wishes known!\nIn seasons of distress and grief,\nMy soul has often found relief.\nAnd oft escaped the tempters snare,\nBy thy return, sweet hour of prayer.","Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!\nThy wings shall my petition bear\nTo Him whose truth and faithfulness\nEngage the waiting soul to bless.\nAnd since He bids me seek His face,\nBelieve His word, and trust His grace,\nI'll cast on Him my every care,\nAnd wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.","Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!\nMay I thy consolation share\nTill from Mount Pisgah's lofty height\nI view my home and take my flight.\nIn my immortal flesh I'll rise\nTo seize the everlasting prize.\nAnd shout while passing through the air,\n\"Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!\""],"chorus":""}
