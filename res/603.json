Christian, Seek Not Repose","verses":["Christian, seek not yet repose,\nCast thy dreams of ease away;\nThou art in the midst of foes;\nWatch and pray!","Gird thy heavenly armor on,\nWear it ever, night and day;\nAmbushed lies the evil one;\nWatch and pray!","Hear the victors who o'ercame;\nStill they mark each warrior's way;\nAll with one sweet voice exclaim:\n\"Watch and pray!\"","Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,\nHim thou lovest to obey;\nHide within thy heart His word:\n\"Watch and pray!\"","Watch, as if on that alone\nHung the issue of the day;\nPray that help may be sent down;\nWatch and pray!"],"chorus":""}
