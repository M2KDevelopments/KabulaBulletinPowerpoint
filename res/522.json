{"number":522,"title":"522. My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less","verses":["My hope is built on nothing less\nThan Jesus' blood and righteousness;\nI dare not trust the sweetest frame,\nBut wholly lean on Jesus' name.","When darkness seems to veil His face,\nI rest on His unchanging grace;\nIn every high and stormy gale,\nMy anchor holds within the veil.","His oath, His covenant, and blood,\nSupport me in the whelming flood;\nWhen all around my soul gives way,\nHe then is all my hope and stay.","When He shall come with trumpet sound,\nO may I then in Him be found;\nClad in His righteousness alone,\nFaultless to stand before the throne."],"chorus":"On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;\nAll other ground is sinking sand,\nAll other ground is sinking sand."}
