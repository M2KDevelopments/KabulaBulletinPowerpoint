As Pants the Hart","verses":["As pants the hart for cooling streams\nWhen heated in the chase,\nSo longs my soul, O God, for Thee,\nAnd Thy refreshing grace.","For Thee, my God, the living God,\nMy thirsty soul doth pine\nO when shall I behold Thy face,\nThou Majesty divine?","Why restless, why cast down, my soul?\nHope still, and thou shalt sing\nThe praise of Him who is thy God,\nThy health's eternal spring.","To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\nThe God whom we adore,\nBe glory, as it was, is now,\nAnd shall be evermore."],"chorus":""}
