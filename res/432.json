{"number":432,"title":"432. Shall We Gather at the River","verses":["Shall we gather at the river\nWhere bright angel feet have trod,\nWith its crystal tide forever\nFlowing by the throne of God?","On the margin of the river,\nWashing up its silver spray\nWe will walk and worship ever,\nAll the happy golden day.","Ere we reach the shining river,\nLay we every burden down;\nGrace our spirits will deliver,\nAnd provide a robe and crown.","Soon we'll reach the shining river,\nSoon our pilgrimage will cease,\nSoon our happy hearts will quiver\nWith the melody of peace."],"chorus":"Yes, we'll gather at the river,\nThe beautiful, the beautiful river;\nGather with the saints at the river\nThat flows by the throne of God."}
