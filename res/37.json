O Sing, My Soul, Your Maker's Praise","verses":["O sing my soul, your Maker's praise\nIn grateful hymns ascending;\nWhose steadfast love has crowned your days\nWith heav'nly gifts unending.\nI sought the Lord, He heard my cry;\nHis holy angels hover nigh\nThe tents of those who love Him.","The Lord is good to those who seek\nHis face in time of sorrow,\nPro'viding comfort to the weak\nAnd grace for each tomorrow.\nThough grief may tarry for a night,\nThe morn shall break in joy and light\nWith blessings from His presence.","The Lord will turn His face in peace\nWhen troubled souls draw near Him;\nHis lovingkindness shall not cease\nTo those who trust and fear Him.\nOur God will not forsake His own;\nEternal is His heav'nly throne;\nHis kingdom stands forever."],"chorus":""}
