Nearer My God, to Thee","verses":["Nearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee!\nE'en though it be a cross\nThat raiseth me!\nStill all my song shall be,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee.","Though like a wanderer,\nDaylight all gone,\nDarkness be over me,\nMy rest a stone;\nYet in my dreams I'd be\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee.","There let the way appear,\nSteps up to heaven;\nAll that Thou sendest me,\nIn mercy given;\nAngels to beckon me\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee.","Then, with my waking thoughts\nBright with Thy praise,\nOut of my stony griefs\nBethel I raise;\nSo by my woes to be\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee.","Or if, on joyful wing\nCleaving the sky,\nSun, moon, and stars forgot,\nUpward I fly,\nStill all my song shall be,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee."],"chorus":""}
