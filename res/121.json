Go Tell It On the Mountain","verses":["Go, tell it on the mountain,\nOver the hills and everywhere:\nGo, tell it on the mountain\nThat Jesus Christ is born!","The shepherds feared and trembled\nWhen lo! Above the earth\nRang out the angel chorus\nThat hailed our Savior's birth.","Down in a lowly manger\nThe humble Christ was born,\nAnd brought us God's salvation\nThat blessed Christmas morn."],"chorus":"While shepherds kept their watching\nO'er silent flocks by night,\nBehold throughout the heavens\nThere shone a holy light."}
