Rescue the Perishing","verses":["Rescue the perishing,\nCare for the dying;\nSnatch them in pity from sin and the grave;\nWeep o'er the erring one,\nLift up the fallen,\nTell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.","Though they are slighting Him,\nStill He is waiting,\nWaiting the penitent child to receive.\nPlead with them earnestly,\nPlead with them gently;\nHe will forgive if they only believe.","Rescue the perishing,\nDuty demands it;\nStrength for thy labor the Lord will provide;\nBack to the narrow way\nPatiently win them;\nTell the poor wanderer a Savior has died."],"chorus":"Rescue the perishing,\nCare for the dying;\nJesus is merciful,\nJesus will save."}
