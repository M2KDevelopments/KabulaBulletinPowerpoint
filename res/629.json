{"number":629,"title":"629. O Happy Band of Pilgrims","verses":["O happy band of pilgrims,\nIf onward ye will tread\nWith Jesus as your fellow,\nTo Jesus as your Head!","O happy if ye labor\nAs Jesus did for men;\nO happy if ye hunger\nAs Jesus hungered then!","The trials that beset you,\nThe sorrows ye endure,\nThe manifold temptations\nThat death alone can cure,","What are they but His jewels\nOf right celestial worth?\nWhat are they but the ladder\nSet up to heaven on earth?","O happy band of pilgrims,\nLook upward to the skies,\nWhere such a light affliction\nShall win you such a prize!"],"chorus":""}
