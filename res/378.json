Go, Preach My Gospel","verses":["\"Go, preach My gospel,\" saith the Lord;\n\"Bid the whole world My grace receive;\nHe shall be saved who trusts My word,\nAnd they condemned who disbelieve.","\"I'll make your great commission known,\nAnd ye shall prove My gospel true\nBy all the works that I have done,\nBy all the wonders ye shall do.","\"Teach all the nations My commands;\nI'm with you till the world shall end;\nAll power is vested in My hands;\nI can destroy, and I defend.\"","He spake, and light shone round His head;\nOn a brigh cloud to heaven He rode;\nThey to the farthest nations spread\nThe grace of their ascended Lord."],"chorus":""}
