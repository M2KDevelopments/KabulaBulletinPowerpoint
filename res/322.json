{"number":322,"title":"322. Nothing Between","verses":["Nothing between my soul and the Savior,\nNaught of this world's delusive dream:\nI have renounced all sinful pleasure-\nJesus is mine! There's nothing between.","Nothing between, like worldly pleasure:\nHabits of life, though harmless they seem,\nMust not my heart from Him ever sever-\nHe is my all! There's nothing between.","Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,\nThough the whole world against me convene;\nWatching with prayer and much self-denial-\nTriumph at last, With nothing between!"],"chorus":"Nothing between my soul and the Savior,\nSo that His blessed face may be seen;\nNothing preventing the least of His favor:\nKeep the way clear! Let nothing between."}
