O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing","verses":["O for a thousand tongues to sing\nMy great Redeemer's praise,\nThe glories of my God and King,\nThe triumphs of His grace!","My gracious Master and my God,\nAssist me to proclaim\nTo spread thro' all the earth abroad\nThe honors of Thy name.","Jesus! the name that charms our fears,\nThat bids our sorrows cease,\n'Tis music in the sinners' ears,\nTis life, and health, and peace.","He breaks the power of canceled sin,\nHe sets the prisoner free;\nHis blood can make the foulest clean;\nHis blood availed for me.","He speaks, and listening to His voice,\nNew life the dead receive;\nThe mournful, broken hearts rejoice;\nThe humble poor, believe.","Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,\nYour loosened tongues employ;\nYe blind, behold your Savior come;\nAnd leap, ye lame, for joy."],"chorus":""}
