{"number":536,"title":"536. God Who Stretched the Spangled Heavens","verses":["God, who stretched the spangled heavens\nInfinite in time and place,\nFlung the suns in burning radiance\nThrough the silent fields of space;\nWe, Your children in Your likeness,\nShare inventive powers with You;\nGreat Creator, still creating,\nShow us what we yet may do.","We have ventured worlds undreamed of\nSince the childhood of our race;\nKnown the ecstasy of winging\nThrough untraveled realms of space,\nProbed the secrets of the atom,\nYielding unimagined power,\nFacing us with life's destruction\nOr our most triumphant hour.","As each far horizon beckons,\nMay it challenge us anew:\nChildren of creative purpose,\nServing others, honoring You.\nMay our dreams prove rich with promise;\nEach endeavor well begun;\nGreat Creator, give us guidance\nTill our goals and Yours are one."],"chorus":""}
