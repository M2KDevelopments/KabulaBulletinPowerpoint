{"number":414,"title":"414. Fruitful Trees the Spirit's Sowing","verses":["Fruitful trees, the Spirit's sowing,\nMay we ripen and increase,\nFruit to life eternal growing,\nRich in love and joy and peace.","Laden branches freely bearing\nGifts the Giver loves to bless;\nHere is fruit that grows by sharing,\nPatience, kindness, gentleness.","Rooted deep in Christ, our Master,\nChrist, our pattern and our goal,\nTeach us, as the years fly faster,\nGoodness, faith, and self control.","Fruitful trees, the Spirit's tending,\nMay we grow till harvests cease;\nTill we taste, in life unending,\nHeaven's love and joy and peace."],"chorus":""}
