Blest Be the Tie That Binds","verses":["Blest be the tie that binds\nOur hearts in Christian love!\nThe fellowship of kindred minds\nIs like to that above.","Before our Father's throne\nWe pour our ardent prayers;\nOur fears, our hopes, our aims are one,\nOur comforts, and our cares.","We share our mutual woes,\nOur mutual burdens bear,\nAnd often for each other flows\nThe sympathizing tear.","When we asunder part,\nIt gives us inward pain;\nBut we shall still be joined in heart,\nAnd hope to meet again."],"chorus":""}
