{"number":261,"title":"261. The Spirit of the Lord Revealed","verses":["The Spirit of the Lord revealed\nHis will to saints of old;\nTheir heart and mind lips unsealed\nHis glory to unfold.\nAmid the gloom of ancient night\nThey hailed the dawning Word,\nAnd in the coming of the light\nProclaimed the coming Lord.","The prophets passed; at length there came\nTo sojourn and abide,\nThe Word incarnate, to whose name\nThe prophets testified;\nAnd He, the twilight overpast,\nHimself, the Light of light,\nAs man with man, revealed at last\nThe Father to our sight.","Eternal Spirit, who dost speak\nTo mind and conscience still,\nThat we in this our day, may seek\nTo do our Father's will,\nTo us the word of life impart,\nOf Christ, the living way;\nGive us the quiet, humble heart\nTo hear and to obey."],"chorus":""}
