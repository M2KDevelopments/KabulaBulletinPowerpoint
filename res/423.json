{"number":423,"title":"423. Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken","verses":["Glorious things of thee are spoken,\nZion, city of our God;\nHe whose word cannot be broken\nFormed thee for His own abode;\nOn the Rock of Ages founded,\nWhat can shake thy sure repose?\nWith salvation's wall surrounded,\nThou mayst smile at all thy foes.","See the streams of living waters\nSpringing from eternal love,\nWell supply thy sons and daughters,\nAnd all fear and want remove;\nWho can faint when such a river\nEver flows their thirst to assuage?\nGrace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,\nNever fails from age to age.","Round each habitation hovering,\nSee the cloud and fire appear\nFor a glory and a covering,\nShowing that the Lord is near;\nBlest inhabitants of Zion,\nWashed in the Redeemer's blood;\nJesus, whom their souls rely on,\nMakes them kings and priests to God.","Savior, if of Zion's city\nI, through grace, a member am,\nLet the world deride or pity,\nI will glory in Thy name;\nFading is the worldling's pleasure,\nAll his boasted pomp and show;\nSolid joys and lasting treasure\nNone but Zion's children know."],"chorus":""}
