{"number":317,"title":"317. Lead Me to Calvary","verses":["King of my life, I crown Thee now,\nThine shall the glory be;\nLest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow,\nLead me to Calvary.","Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,\nTenderly mourned and wept;\nAngels in robes of light arrayed\nGuarded Thee whilst Thou slept.","Let me like Mary, thru the gloom,\nCome with a gift to Thee;\nShow to me now the empty tomb,\nLead me to Calvary.","May I be willing, Lord, to bear\nDaily my cross for Thee;\nEven Thy cup of grief to share,\nThou hast borne all for me."],"chorus":"Lest I forget Gethsemane;\nLest I forget Thine agony;\nLest I forget Thy love for me,\nLead me to Calvary."}
