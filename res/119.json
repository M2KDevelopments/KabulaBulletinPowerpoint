Angels, from the Realms of Glory","verses":["Angels from the realms of glory,\nWing your flight o'er all the earth;\nYe who sang creation's story,\nNow proclaim Messiah's birth;\nCome and worship, Come and worship,\nWorship Christ, the newborn King.","Shepherds, in the field abiding,\nWatching o'er your flocks by night,\nGod with man is now residing;\nYonder shines the Infant Light:\nCome and worship, Come and worship,\nWorship Christ, the newborn King.","Sages, leave your contemplations,\nBrighter visions beam afar;\nSeek the great Desire of nations;\nYe have seen His natal star;\nCome and worship, Come and worship,\nWorship Christ, the newborn King.","Saints, before the altar bending,\nWatching long in hope and fear,\nSuddenly the Lord, descending,\nIn His temple shall appear;\nCome and worship, Come and worship,\nWorship Christ, the newborn King."],"chorus":""}
