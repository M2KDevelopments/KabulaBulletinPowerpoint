{"number":622,"title":"622. Come Come Ye Saints","verses":["Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor labor fear;\nBut with joy wend your way.\nThough hard to you the journey may appear,\nGrace shall be as your day.\nWe have a living Lord to guide,\nAnd we can trust Him to provide;\nDo this, and joy your hearts will swell:\nAll is well! All is well!","We'll find the rest which God for us prepared,\nWhen at last He will call;\nWhere none will come to hurt or make afraid,\nHe will reign over all.\nWe will make the air with music ring,\nShout praise to God our Lord and King:\nO how we'll make the chorus swell:\nAll is well! All is well!"],"chorus":""}
