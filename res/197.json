{"number":197,"title":"197. The King of Love My Shepherd Is","verses":["The King of love my Shepherd is,\nWhose goodness faileth never;\nI nothing lack if I am His,\nAnd He is mine forever.","Where streams of living water flow\nMy ransomed soul He leadeth,\nAnd, where the verdant pastures grow,\nWith food celestial feedeth.","Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,\nBut yet in love He sought me,\nAnd on His shoulder gently laid,\nAnd home, rejoicing, brought me.","And so through all the length of days\nThy goodness faileth never;\nGood Shepherd! I would sing Thy praise\nWithin Thy house forever."],"chorus":""}
