{"number":497,"title":"497. O Gracious Father of Mankind","verses":["O gracious Father of mankind,\nOur spirits' unseen friend;\nHigh heaven's Lord, our hearts' dear guest,\nTo Thee our prayers ascend.\nThou dost not wait till human speech\nThy gifts divine implore;\nOur dreams, our aims, our work, our lives\nAre prayers Thou lovest more.","Thou hearest these, the good and ill,\nDeep buried in each breast;\nThe secret thought, the hidden plan,\nWrought out our unexpressed.\nO cleanse our prayers from human dross,\nAttune our lives to Thee,\nUntil we labor for those gifts\nWe ask on bended knee.","Our best is but Thyself in us,\nOur highest thought Thy will;\nTo hear Thy voice we need but love,\nAnd listen, and be still.\nWe would not bend Thy will to ours,\nBut blend our wills to Thine;\nNot beat with cries on heaven's doors,\nBut live Thy life divine.","Thou seekest us in love and truth\nMore than our minds seek Thee;\nThrough open gates Thy power flows in\r\nLike flood tides from the sea.\nNo more we seek Thee from afar,\nNor ask Thee for a sign,\nContent to pray in life and love\nAnd toil, till all are Thine."],"chorus":""}
