{"number":179,"title":"179. The Wonders of Redeeming Love","verses":["The wonders of redeeming love\nOur highest thoughts exceed;\nThe Son of God comes from above\nFor sinful man to bleed.","He gives Himself, His life, His all,\nA sinless sacrifice.\nFor man He drains the cup of gall,\nFor man the victim dies.","And now before His Father's face\nHis precious blood He pleads;\nFor those who seek the throne of grace\nHis love still intercedes.","He knows the frailties of our frame,\nFor He has borne our grief;\nOur great High Priest once felt the same,\nAnd He can send relief.","His love will not be satisfied,\nTill He in glory sees\nThe faithful ones for whom He died\nFrom sin forever free."],"chorus":""}
