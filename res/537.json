{"number":537,"title":"537. He Leadeth Me","verses":["He leadeth me! O blessed thought!\nO words with heavenly comfort fraught!\nWhate'er I do, where'er I be,\nStill 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.","Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,\nSometimes where Eden's bowers bloom\nBy waters still, o'er troubled sea;\nStill 'tis His hand that leadeth me!","Lord, I would clasp my hand in Thine,\nNor ever murmur nor repine;\nContent, whatever lot I see,\nSince 'tis my God that leadeth me.","And when my task on earth is done,\nWhen, by Thy grace, the victory's won,\nE'en death's cold wave I will not flee,\nSince God through Jordan leadeth me."],"chorus":"He leadeth me, He leadeth me,\nBy His own hand He leadeth me;\nHis faithful follower I would be,\nFor by His hand He leadeth me."}
