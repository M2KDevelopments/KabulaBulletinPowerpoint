Now Praise the Hidden God of Love","verses":["Now praise the hidden God of love\nIn whom we all must live and move,\r\nWho shepherds us, at every stage\r\nThro' youth, maturity, and age.","Who challenged us, when were young\r\nTo storm the citadels of wrong;\r\nIn care for others taught us how\r\nGod's true community must grow.","Who bids us never lose our zest,\r\nTho' age is urging us to rest,\r\nBut proves to us that we have still\nA work to do, a place to fill.","Then talk no more of wasted time,\r\nBut Godward look, and upward climb,\r\nContent to sleep, when day is done,\r\nAnd rise refreshed, and travel on."],"chorus":""}
