{"number":358,"title":"358. Far and Near the Fields Are Teeming","verses":["Far and near the fields are teeming\nWith the sheaves of ripened grain;\nFar and near their gold is gleaming\nO'er the sunny slope and plain.","Send them forth with morn's first beaming,\nSend them in the noontide's glare;\nWhen the sun's last rays are streaming,\nBid them gather everywhere.","O thou, whom thy Lord is sending,\nGather now the sheaves of gold;\nHeavenward then at evening wending\nThou shalt come with joy untold."],"chorus":"Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!\nHear us, Lord, to Thee we cry;\nSend them now the sheaves to gather,\nEre the harvest-time pass by."}
