{"number":381,"title":"381. Holy Sabbath Day of Rest","verses":["Holy Sabbath day of rest,\nBy our Master richly blest,\nGod-created and divine,\nSet aside for holy time.","Seek not pleasures of this earth,\nWith its folly, noise, and mirth,\nThere are better things in store,\nOver on the other shore.","As the Sabbath draweth on\nFriday eve at set of sun,\nChristian household then should meet,\nSing and pray at Jesus' feet,","Asking Him for saving grace,\nAlso vict'ry in the race,\nAnd to help us by His pow'r,\nTo keep holy every hour."],"chorus":"Yes, the holy Sabbath rest,\nBy our God divinely blest,\nIt to us a sign shall be\nThroughout all eternity."}
