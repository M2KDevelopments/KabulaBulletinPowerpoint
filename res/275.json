{"number":275,"title":"275. O God of Light","verses":["O God of light, Your Word, a lamp unfailing,\nShall pierce the darkness of our earthbound way\nAnd show your grace, Your plan for us unveiling,\nAnd guide our footsteps to the perfect day.","From days of old, through blind and willful ages,\nThough we rebelled, You gently sought again,\nAnd spoke through saints, apostles, prophets, sages,\nWho wrote with eager or reluctant pen.","Undimmed by time, those words are still revealing\nTo sinful hearts Your justice and Your grace;\nAnd questing mortals longing for Your healing,\nSee Your compassion in the Savior's face.","To all the world Your summons You are sending,\nThrough all the earth, to every land and race,\nThat myriad tongues, in one great anthem blending,\nMay praise and celebrate Your gift of grace."],"chorus":""}
