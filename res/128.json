{"number":128,"title":"128. Break Forth, O Beauteous Heavenly Light","verses":["Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light,\nAnd usher in the morning;\nYe shepherds, shrink not with affright,\nBut hear the angel's warning.\nThis Child, now weak in infancy,\nOur confidence and joy shall be,\nThe power of Satan breaking,\nOur peace eternal making.","Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light,\nTo herald our salvation;\nHe stoops to earth â€“ the God of might,\nOur hope and expectation.\nHe comes in human flesh to dwell,\nOur God with us, Immanuel,\nThe night of darkness ending,\nOur fallen race befriending."],"chorus":""}
