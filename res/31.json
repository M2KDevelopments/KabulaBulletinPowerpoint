Tell Out My Soul","verses":["Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord:\nUnnumbered blessings give my spirit voice;\nTender to me the promise of His word;\nIn God my Savior shall my heart rejoice.","Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His name:\nMake known His might, the deeds His arm has done;\nHis mercy sure, from age to age the same;\nHis holy name, the Lord, the Mighty One.","Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might:\nPow'rs and dominions lay their glory by;\nProud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,\nThe hungry fed, the humble lifted high.","Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word:\nFirm is His promise, and His mercy sure.\nTell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord\nTo children's children and forever more."],"chorus":""}
