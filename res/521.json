{"number":521,"title":"521. Depth of Mercy","verses":["Depth of mercy!; can there be\nMercy still reserved for me?\nCan my God His wrath forbear?\nMe, the chief of sinners, spare?","I have long withstood His grace,\nLong provoked Him to His face,\nWould not hearken to His calls,\nGrieved Him by a thousand falls.","Now incline me to repent;\nLet me now my sins lament;\nNow my foul revolt deplore,\nWeep, believe, and sin no more.","There for me the Savior stands,\nShows His wounds and spreads His hands;\nGod is love! I know, I feel;\nJesus weeps, and loves me still."],"chorus":""}
