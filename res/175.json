{"number":175,"title":"175. Now the Green Blade Rises","verses":["Now the green blade rises from the buried grain,\nWheat that in dark earth many days has lain;\nLove lives again, that with the dead has been;\nLove is come again like wheat arising green.","In the grave they laid Him, love by hatred slain,\nThinking that He would never wake again,\nLaid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen;\nLove is come again like wheat arising green.","Forth He came in triumph, like the risen grain,\nHe that for three days in the grave had lain;\nRaised from the dead, my living Lord is seen;\nLove is come again like wheat arising green.","When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain,\nYour touch can call us back to life again,\nFields of our hearts that dead and bare have been;\nLove is come again like wheat arising green"],"chorus":""}
