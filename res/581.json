{"number":581,"title":"581. When the Church of Jesus","verses":["When the church of Jesus\nShuts its outer door,\nLest the roar of traffic\nDrown the voice of prayer:\nMay our prayers, Lord, make us\nTen times more aware\nThat the world banish\nIs our Christian care.","If our hearts are lifted\nWhere devotion soars\nHigh above this hungry\nSuffering world of ours;\nLest our hymns should drug us\nTo forget its needs,\nForge our Christian worship\nInto Christian deeds.","Lest the gifts we offer,\nMoney, talents, time,\nServe to salve our conscience\nTo our secret shame;\nLord, reprove, inspire us\nBy the way you give;\nTeach us, dying Savior,\nHow true Christians live."],"chorus":""}
