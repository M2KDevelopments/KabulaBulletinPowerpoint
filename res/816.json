{"title":"    816. Preparation for Christ's Coming - 1 Thessalonians 5  ","number":816,"verses":["\n      You know very well that the day of the Lord\nwill come like a thief in the night.\nWhile people are saying, \"Peace and safety,\"\ndestruction will come on them suddenly,\nas labor pains on a pregnant woman,\nand they will not escape.\n    ","\n      But you, brothers, are not in darkness\nso that this day should surprise you like a thief.\nYou are all sons of the light and sons of the day.\nWe do not belong to the night or to the darkness.\n    ","\n      So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep,\nbut let us be alert and self-controlled.\nFor those who sleep, sleep at night,\nand those who get drunk, get drunk at night.\n    ","\n      But since we belong to the day,\nlet us be self-controlled,\nputting on faith and love as a breastplate,\nand the hope of salvation as a helmet.\n    ","\n      For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath\nbut to receive salvation\nthrough our Lord Jesus Christ.\nHe died for us so that,\nwhether we are awake or asleep,\nwe may live together with him.\n    ","\n      Therefore encourage one another\nand build each other up,\njust as in fact you are doing.\n    "]}
