Let the Redeemed Thank the Lord - Psalm 107  ","number":728,"verses":["Let [the redeemed] thank the Lord\nfor his steadfast love,\nfor his wonderful works to the sons\tof men!...\nAnd let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving,\nand tell of his deeds in songs of joy!","Some went down to the sea in ships,\ndoing business on the great waters;\nthey saw the deeds of the Lord,\nhis wondrous works in the deep.","For he commanded, and raised the stormy wind,\nwhich lifted up the waves of the sea.","They mounted up to heaven,\nthey went down to the depths;\ntheir courage melted away in their evil plight;\nthey reeled and staggered like drunken men,\nand were at their wits' end.","Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,\nand he delivered them from their distress;\nhe made the storm be still,\nand the waves of the sea were hushed.","Then they were glad because they had quiet,\nand he brought them to their desired haven.\nLet them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,\nfor his wonderful works to the sons of men!","Let them extol him in the congregation\r\nof the people,\nand praise him in the assembly of the elders.","He turns rivers into a desert,\nsprings of water into thirsty ground,\na fruitful land into a salty waste,\nbecause of the wickedness of its inhabitants.","He turns a desert into pools of water,\na parched land into springs of water.\nAnd there he lets the hungry dwell,\nand they establish a city to live in;\nthey sow fields, and plant vineyards,\r\nand get a fruitful yield.","Whoever is wise, let him give heed\nto these things;\nlet men consider the steadfast love\nof the Lord."]}
