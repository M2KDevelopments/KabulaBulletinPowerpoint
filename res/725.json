{"title":"725. God Works for Good - Romans 8  ","number":725,"verses":["I consider that our present sufferings\nare not worth comparing\twith the glory\nthat will be revealed in us.\n    ","The creation waits in eager expectation\nfor the sons of God to be revealed.\n    ","For the creation was subjected to frustration,\nnot by its own choice,\nbut by the will of the one who subjected it,\nin hope that the creation itself\nwill be liberated from its bondage to decay\nand brought into the glorious freedom\nof the children of God.\n    ","And we know that in all things\nGod works for me good\nof those who love him,\nwho have been called\naccording to his purpose.\n    ","What, then, shall we say in response to this?\nIf God is for us, who can be against us?\n    ","He who did not spare his own Son,\nbut gave him up for us all-\nhow will he not also, along\twith him,\ngraciously give us all things?\n    "]}
