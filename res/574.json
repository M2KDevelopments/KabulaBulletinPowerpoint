{"number":574,"title":"574. O Master, Let Me Walk With Thee","verses":["O Master, let me walk with Thee\nIn lowly paths of service free;\nTell me Thy secret; help me bear\nThe strain of toil, the fret of care.","Help me the slow of heart to move\nBy some clear, winning word of love;\nTeach me the wayward feet to stay,\nAnd guide them in the homeward way.","Teach me Thy patience; still with Thee\nIn closer, dearer company,\nIn work that keeps faith sweet and strong,\nIn trust that triumphs over wrong;","In hope that sends a shining ray\nFar down the future's broadening way;\nIn peace that only Thou canst give,\nWith Thee, O Master, let me live."],"chorus":""}
