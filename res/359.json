{"number":359,"title":"359. Hark! the Voice of Jesus Calling","verses":["Hark! the voice of Jesus calling,\n\"Who will go and work today?\nFields are white, the harvest waiting,\nWho will bear the sheaves away?\"\nLoud and long the Master calleth,\nRich reward He offers free;\nWho will answer, gladly saying,\n\"Here am I, O Lord, send me\"?","If you cannot cross the ocean\nAnd the heathen lands explore,\nYou can find the heathen nearer,\nYou can help them at your door;\nIf you cannot speak like angels,\nIf you cannot preach like Paul,\nYou can tell the love of Jesus,\nYou can say He died for all.","If you cannot be the watchman,\nStanding high on Zion's wall,\nPointing out the path to heaven,\nOffering life and peace to all;\nWith your prayers and with your bounties\nYou can do what Heaven demands,\nYou can be like faithful Aaron,\nHolding up the prophet's hands.","While the souls of men are dying,\nAnd the Master calls for you,\nLet none hear you idly saying,\n\"There is nothing I can do!\"\nGladly take the task He gives you,\nLet His work your pleasure be;\nAnswer quickly when He calleth,\n\"Here am I, O Lord, send me.\""],"chorus":""}
