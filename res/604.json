{"number":604,"title":"604. We Know Not the Hour","verses":["We know not the hour of the Master's appearing;\nYet signs all foretell that the moment is nearing\nWhen He shall return; 'tis a promise most cheering;\nBut we know not the hour.","There's light for the wise who are seeking salvation;\nThere's truth in the book of the Lord's revelation;\nEach prophecy points to the great consummation;\nBut we know not the hour.","We'll watch and we'll pray, with our lamps trimmed and burning;\nWe'll work and we'll wait till the Master's returning;\nWe'll sing and rejoice, every omen discerning;\nBut we know not the hour."],"chorus":"He will come, let us watch and be ready;\nHe will come, hallelujah! hallelujah!\nHe will come in the clouds of His Father's bright glory\nBut we know not the hour."}
