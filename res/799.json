{"title":"799. Do Not Worry - Psalm 37  ","number":799,"verses":["Do not worry about the wicked,\ndo not envy those who do wrong.\nQuick as the grass they wither,\nfading like the green in the field.","Trust in Yahweh and do what is good,\nmake your home in the land and live in peace;\nmake Yahweh your only joy and he will give you\nwhat your heart desires.","Commit your fate to Yahweh,\ntrust in him and he will act:\nmaking your virtue clear as the light,\nyour integrity as bright as noon.","Be quiet before Yahweh,\nand wait patiently for him,\nnot worrying about men who make their fortunes,\nabout men who scheme to bring\nthe poor and needy down.","Enough of anger, leave rage aside,\ndo not worry, nothing but evil can come of it:\nfor the wicked will be expelled,\nwhile those who hope in Yahweh\nshall have the land for their own.","A little longer, and the wicked will be no more,\nsearch his place well, he will not be there:\nbut the humble shall have the land for their own\nto enjoy untroubled peace."]}
