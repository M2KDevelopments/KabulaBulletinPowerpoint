{"number":395,"title":"395. As Birds Unto the Genial Homeland","verses":["As birds unto the genial homeland fly,\nThe winter's cold and low'ring skies to flee,\nSo seeks my soul Thy gracious presence here\nAnd finds, O God, its rest and peace in Thee.","Here at Thy shrine we leave all vexing care,\nFor get the disappointment, grief and tear,\nAnd on the wings of hopeful song and prayer\nWe rise, and rising feel Thy Spirit here.","Bless all who spend this night in pain and woe,\nThe burdened heart, the fainting, and distressed,\nThy comfort send to darkened homes bereaved,\nThy saving help to those by want oppressed.","Come, Sabbath joy, each trusting heart now fill,\nAnd blissful peace within our homes abide,\nMay thankful praise each grateful heart now thrill,\nAnd to God's loving care their lives confide."],"chorus":""}
