Working, O Christ, With Thee","verses":["Working, O Christ, with Thee,\nWorking with Thee,\nUnworthy, sinful, weak,\nThough we may be;\nOur all to Thee we give,\nFor Thee alone we live,\nAnd by Thy grace achieve,\nWorking with Thee.","Along the city's waste,\nWorking with Thee,\nOur eager footsteps haste,\nLike Thee to be;\nThe poor we gather in,\nThe outcasts raise from sin,\nAnd labor souls to win,\nWorking with Thee.","Savior, we weary not,\nWorking with Thee,\nAs hard as Thine our lot\nCan never be;\nOur joy and comfort this,\n\"Thy grace sufficient is;\"\nThis changes toil to bliss,\nWorking with Thee.","So let us labor on,\nWorking with Thee,\nTill earth to Thee is won,\nFrom sin set free;\nTill men, from shore to shore,\nReceive Thee, and adore,\nAnd join us evermore,\nWorking with Thee."],"chorus":""}
