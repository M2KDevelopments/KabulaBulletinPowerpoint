{"number":259,"title":"259. Draw Us in the Spirits Tether","verses":["Draw us in the Spirit's tether,\nFor when humbly in Thy name,\nTwo or three are met together,\nThou art in the midst of them;\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\r\nTouch we now Thy garment's hem.","As the brethren used to gather\nIn the name of Christ to sup,\nThen with thanks to God the Father\nBreak the bread and bless the cup,\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\nSo knit Thou our friendship up.","All our meals and all our living\nMake us sacraments of Thee,\nThat by caring, helping, giving,\nWe may true disciples be.\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\nWe will serve Thee faithfully."],"chorus":""}
