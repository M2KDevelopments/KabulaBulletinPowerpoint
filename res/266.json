{"number":266,"title":"266. Spirit of God","verses":["Spirit of God! descend upon my heart;\nWean it from earth; through all its pulses move;\nStoop to my weakness, mighty as Thou art,\nAnd make me love Thee as I ought to love.","I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies;\nNo sudden rending of the veil of clay;\nNo angel visitant, no op'ning skies;\nBut take the dimness of my soul away.","Hast Thou not bid us love Thee, God and King?\nAll, all Thine own, soul, heart, and strength, and mind;\nI see Thy cross, there teach my heart to cling:\nO let me seek Thee, and O let me find!","Teach me to feel that Thou art always nigh;\nTeach me the struggles of the soul to bear;\nTo check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh;\nTeach me the patience of unanswered prayer.","Teach me to love Thee as Thine angels love,\nOne holy passion filling all my frame;\nThe baptism of the heav'n-descended dove,\nMy heart an altar, and Thy love the flame."],"chorus":""}
