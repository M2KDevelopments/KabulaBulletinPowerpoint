{"number":493,"title":"493. Fill My Cup Lord","verses":["Like the woman at the well I was seeking\nFor things that could not satisfy;\nAnd then I heard my Savior speaking:\n\"Draw from My well that shall never run dry.\"","There are millions in this world who are craving\nThe pleasure earthly things afford;\nBut none can match the wondrous treasure\nThat I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.","So, my children, if the things this world gave you\nLeave hungers that won't pass away,\nMy blessed Lord will come and save you,\nIf you kneel to Him and humbly pray:"],"chorus":"Fill my cup, Lord, I lift it up, Lord!\nCome and quench this thirsting of my soul;\nBread of heaven, feed me till I want no more-\nFill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!"}
