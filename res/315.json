{"number":315,"title":"315. O for a Closer Walk!","verses":["O, for a closer walk with God!\nA calm and heavenly frame,\nA light to shine upon the road\nThat leads me to the Lamb.","Return, O holy Dove! return,\nSweet messenger of rest;\nI hate the sins that made Thee mourn,\nAnd drove Thee from my breast.","What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!\nHow sweet their memory still!\nBut they have left an aching void\nThe world can never fill.","The dearest idol I have known,\nWhate'er that idol be,\nHelp me to tear it from Thy throne,\nAnd worship only Thee."],"chorus":""}
