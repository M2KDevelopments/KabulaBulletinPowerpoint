Growing in Christ (Sanctification) - Colossians 3  ","number":789,"verses":["Since you have been brought back to\ntrue life with Christ,\nyou must look for the things\nthat are in heaven, where Christ is,\nsitting at God's right hand.\n    ","Let your thoughts be on heavenly things,\nnot on the things that are on the earth,\nbecause you have died,\nand now the life you have is hidden with Christ in God.\n    ","But when Christ is revealed and he is your life\nyou too will be revealed\nin all your glory with him.\n    ","That is why you must kill everything in you\r\nthat belongs only to earthly life:\nfornication, impurity, guilty passion,\nevil desires and especially greed,\nwhich is the same thing as worshipping a false god;\nall this is the\r\nsort of behaviour that makes God angry.\n    ","And it is the way in which you used to live\nwhen you were surrounded by\npeople doing the same thing,\nbut now you, of all people,\nmust give all these things up:\ngetting angry, being bad-tempered, spitefulness,\nabusive language and dirty talk;\nand never tell each other lies.\n    ","You have stripped off your old\nbehaviour with your old self,\nand you have put on a new self which will\nprogress towards true knowledge\nthe more it is renewed\nin the image of its creator;\n    ","and in that image there is no room\r\nfor distinction between Greek and Jew,\nbetween the circumcised or the uncircumcised,\nor between barbarian and Scythian, slave and free man.\n    ","There is only Christ:\nhe is everything and he is in everything.\n    "]}
