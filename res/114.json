{"number":114,"title":"114. There's a Wideness","verses":["There's a wideness in God's mercy,\nLike the wideness of the sea;\nThere's a kindness in His justice,\nWhich is more than liberty.","There is welcome for the sinner,\nAnd more graces for the good;\nThere is mercy with the Savior;\nThere is healing in His blood.","For the love of God is broader\nThan the measure of man's mind,\nAnd the heart of the Eternal\nIs most wonderfully kind.","If our love were but more simple,\nWe should take Him at His word;\nAnd our lives would be all sunshine\nIn the sweetness of our Lord."],"chorus":""}
