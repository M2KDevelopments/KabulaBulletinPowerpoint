{"number":576,"title":"576. Awake, Awake to Love and Work","verses":["Awake, awake to love and work!\nThe lark is in the sky;\nThe fields are wet with diamond dew;\nThe worlds awake to cry\nTheir blessings on the Lord of life,\nAs He goes meekly by.","Come, let thy voice be one with theirs,\nShout with their shout of praise;\nSee how the giant sun soars up,\nGreat lord of years and days!\nSo let the love of Jesus come\nAnd set thy soul ablaze.","To give and give, and give again,\nWhat God hath given thee;\nTo spend thyself nor count the cost;\nTo serve right gloriously\nThe God who gave all worlds that are,\nAnd all that are to be."],"chorus":""}
