Loving Shepherd of Thy Sheep","verses":["Loving Shepherd of Thy sheep,\nKeep Thy lamb, in safety keep;\nNothing can Thy power withstand;\nNone can pluck me from Thy hand.","Loving Shepherd, ever near,\nTeach Thy lamb Thy voice to hear;\nSuffer not my steps to stray\nFrom the straight and narrow way.","Where Thou leadest I would go,\nWalking in Thy steps below,\nTill within the heavenly fold\nI my Shepherd shall behold."],"chorus":""}
