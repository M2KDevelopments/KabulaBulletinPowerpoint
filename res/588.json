{"number":588,"title":"588. Lord of All Nations","verses":["Lord of all nations, grant me grace\nTo love all people, every race,\nAnd in each person may I see\nMy kindred loved, redeemer by Thee.","Break down the wall that would divide\nThy children Lord, on every side.\nMy neighbor's good let me pursue;\nLet Christian love bind warm and true.","Forgive me, Lord, where I have erred\nBy loveless act and thoughtless word.\nMake me to see the wrong I do\nWill crucify my Lord anew.","Give me Thy courage, Lord, to speak\nWhenever strong oppress the weak.\nShould I myself the victim be,\nHelp me forgive, rememb'ring Thee","With Thine own love may I be filled\nAnd by Thy Holy Spirit willed,\nThat all I touch, where'er I be,\nMay be divinely touched by Thee."],"chorus":""}
