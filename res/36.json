{"number":36,"title":"36. O Thou in Whose Presence","verses":["O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,\nOn whom in affliction I call,\nMy comfort by day and my song in the night,\nMy hope, my salvation, my all!","His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,\nIs heard through the shadows of death;\nThe cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,\nThe air is perfumed with His breath.","His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,\nTo water the gardens of grace;\nFrom which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,\nAnd bask in the smiles of His face.","He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,\nAnd myriads wait for His word;\nHe speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,\nRe-echoes the praise of the Lord."],"chorus":""}
