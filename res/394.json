{"number":394,"title":"394. Far From All Care","verses":["Far from all care we hail the Sabbath morning;\nO'er waving fields and from the distant sea\nSwell notes of praise in harmony resounding\nAs all creation turns her heart to Thee.","Though man alone, Lord, of Thy great creation\nFails now to laud Thee for Thy love and power,\nYet still a remnant love Thee and remember\nThy holy law and each sweet Sabbath hour.","Lord of the Sabbath, Savior and Creator,\nCalm now the throbbings of each troubled breast.\nSpeak to our hearts the peace of Thy commandments,\nBreathe on each soul fair Eden's hallowed rest.","Strong in Thy might and quiet in Thy meekness,\nMay we Thine image bear from day to day.\nThen may we enter pearly gates eternal\nAnd sing redemption's song each Sabbath day."],"chorus":""}
