{"number":127,"title":"127. Infant Holy, Infant Lowly","verses":["Infant holy, infant lowly,\nFor His bed a cattle stall;\nOxen lowing, little knowing\nChrist the babe is Lord of all;\nSwift are winging angels singing,\nNoels ringing, tidings bringing,\nChrist the babe is Lord of all,\nChrist the babe is Lord of all.","Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping\nVigil till the morning new;\nSaw the glory, heard the story,\nTidings of the gospel true;\nThus rejoicing, free from sorrow,\nPraises voicing greet the morrow,\nChrist the babe was born for you,\nChrist the babe was born for you."],"chorus":""}
