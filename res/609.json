{"number":609,"title":"609. Am I a Soldier of the Cross?","verses":["Am I a soldier of the cross,\nA follower of the Lamb?\nAnd shall I fear to own His cause?\nOr blush to speak His name?","Must I be carried to the skies\nOn flowery beds of ease,\nWhilst others fought to win the prize,\nAnd sailed through bloody seas?","Are there no foes for me to face?\nMust I not stem the flood?\nIs this vile world a friend of grace,\nTo help me on to God?","Sure I must fight if I would reign;\nIncrease my courage, Lord;\nI'll bear the toil, endure the pain,\nSupported by Thy word.","Thy saints in all this glorious war\nShall conquer, though they die;\nThey see the triumph from afar,\nWith faith's discerning eye.","When that illustrious day shall rise,\nAnd all Thy armies shine\nIn robes of victory through the skies,\nThe glory shall be Thine."],"chorus":""}
