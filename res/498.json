{"number":498,"title":"498. Still, Still With Thee","verses":["Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,\nWhen the bird waketh, and the shadow's flee;\nFairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,\nDawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.","Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows,\nThe solemn hush of nature newly born;\nAlone with Thee in breathless adoration,\nIn the calm dew and freshness of the morn.","Still, still with Thee! As to each newborn morning\nA fresh and solemn splendor still is given,\nSo does this blessed consciousness, awaking,\nBreathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.","So shall it be at last, in that bright morning,\nWhen the soul waketh and life's shadows flee;\nO in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,\nShall rise the glorious thought, I am with Thee."],"chorus":""}
