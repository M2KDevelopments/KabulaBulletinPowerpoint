{"number":529,"title":"529. Under His Wings","verses":["Under His wings I am safely abiding;\nThough the night deepens and tempests are wild,\nStill I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;\nHe has redeemed me, and I am His child.","Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!\nHow the heart yearningly turns to its rest!\nOften when earth has no balm for my healing,\nThere I find comfort, and there I am blest.","Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!\nThere will I hide till life's trials are o'er;\nSheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;\nResting in Jesus I'm safe evermore."],"chorus":"Under His wings, under His wings,\nWho from His love can sever?\nUnder His wings my soul shall abide,\nSafely abide forever."}
