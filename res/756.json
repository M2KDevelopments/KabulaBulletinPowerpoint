Have Mercy on Me, O God - Psalm 51  ","number":756,"verses":["Have mercy on me, O God,\naccording to your unfailing love;\naccording to your great compassion\nblot out my transgressions.\nWash away an my iniquity\nand cleanse me from my sin.","For I know my transgressions,\nand my sin is always before me.\nAgainst you, you only, have I sinned\nand done what is evil in your sight,\nso that you are proved right when you speak\nand justified when you judge.","Surely I have been a sinner from birth,\nsinful from the time my mother conceived me.\nSurely you desire truth in the inner parts;\nyou teach me wisdom in the inmost place.","Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean;\nwash me, and I will be whiter than snow.","Let me hear joy and gladness;\nlet the bones you have crushed rejoice.\nHide your face from my sins\nand blot out all my iniquity.","Create in me a pure heart, O God,\nand renew a steadfast spirit within me.\nDo not cast me from your presence\nor take your Holy Spirit from me.\nRestore to me the joy of your salvation\nand grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.","Then I will teach transgressors your ways,\nand sinners will turn back to you.\nSave me from blood guilt,\r\nO God, the God who saves me;\nand my tongue will sing of your righteousness.","O Lord, open my lips,\nand my mouth will declare your praise.\nYou do not delight in sacrifice\nor I would bring it;\nyou do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.","The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;\na broken and contrite heart,\r\nO God, you will not despise."]}
