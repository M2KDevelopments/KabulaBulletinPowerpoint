{"number":336,"title":"336. There Is a Fountain","verses":["There is a fountain filled with blood,\nDrawn from Immanuel's veins;\nAnd sinners plunged beneath that flood,\nLose all their guilty stains\nLose all their guilty stains,\nLose all their guilty stains;\nAnd sinners plunged beneath that flood,\nLose all their guilty stains.","The dying thief rejoiced to see\nThat fountain in his day;\nAnd there may I, though vile as he,\nWash all my sins away,\nWash all my sins away,\nWash all my sins away;\nAnd there may I, though vile as he,\nWash all my sins away.","Thou dying Lamb! Thy precious blood\nShall never lose its power\nTill all the ransomed church of God\nAre saved, to sin no more,\nAre saved, to sin no more,\nAre saved, to sin no more;\nTill all the ransomed church of God\nAre saved, to sin no more.","E'er since by faith I saw the stream\nThy flowing wounds supply,\nRedeeming love has been my theme,\nAnd shall be till I die,\nAnd shall be till I die,\nAnd shall be till I die;\nRedeeming love has been my theme,\nAnd shall be till I die.","Lord, I believe Thou hast prepared,\nUnworthy though I be,\nFor me a blood-bought, free reward,\nA golden harp for me!\nA golden harp for me!\nA golden harp for me!\nFor me a blood-bought, free reward,\nA golden harp for me!","There in a nobler, sweeter song,\nI'll sing Thy power to save,\nWhen this poor lisping, stammering tongue\nIs ransomed from the grave,\nIs ransomed from the grave,\nIs ransomed from the grave;\nWhen this poor lisping, stammering tongue\nIs ransomed from the grave."],"chorus":""}
