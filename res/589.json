{"number":589,"title":"589. Holy Spirit Gracious Guest","verses":["Holy Spirit, gracious guest,\nHear and grant our heart's request\nFor that gift supreme and best\nHoly heav'nly love.","Faith that mountains could remove,\nTongues of earth or heaven above,\nKnowledge, all things, empty prove\nIf I have no love.","Though I as a martyr bleed,\r\nGive my goods the poor to feed,\nAll is vain if love I need:\nTherefore give me love.","Love is kind and suffers long,\nLove is pure and thinks no wrong;\nLove than death ifself more strong:\nTherefore give us love.","Prophecy will fade away,\nMelting in the light of day;\nLove will ever with us stay:\nTherefore give us love.","Faith and hope and love we see\nJoining hand in had agree-\nBut the greatest of the three,\nAnd the best is love."],"chorus":""}
