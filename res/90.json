{"number":90,"title":"90. Eternal God Whose Power Upholds","verses":["Eternal God, whose power upholds\nBoth flower and flaming star,\nTo whom there is no here nor there,\nNo time, no near nor far,\nNo alien race, no foreign shore,\nNo child unsought, unknown:\nO send us forth, Your prophets true,\nTo make all lands Your own!","O God of truth, whom science seeks\r\nAnd reverent souls adore,\nIllumine every earnest mind\nOf every clime and shore:\nDispel the gloom of error's night,\nOf ignorance and fear,\nUntil true wisdom from above\nShall make life's pathway clear!","O God of beauty, oft revealed\r\nIn dreams of human art,\nIn speech that flows to melody,\nIn holiness of heart:\nTeach us to ban all ugliness,\nAnd all disharmony,\nTill all shall know the loveliness\nOf lives made fair and free!","O God of righteousness and grace,\r\nSeen in the Christ, Your Son,\nWhose life and death reveal Your face,\nBy whom Your will was done;\nHelp us to spread Your gracious reign\nTill greed and hate shall cease,\nAnd kindness dwell in human hearts,\nAnd all the earth find peace!"],"chorus":""}
