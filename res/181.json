{"number":181,"title":"181. Does Jesus Care?","verses":["Does Jesus care when my heart is pained\nToo deeply for mirth and song;\nAs the burdens press, and the cares distress,\nAnd the way grows weary and long?","Does Jesus care when my way is dark\nWith a nameless dread and fear?\nAs the daylight fades into deep night shades,\nDoes He care enough to be near?","Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye\nTo the dearest on earth to me,\nAnd my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks\nIs it aught to Him? does He see?"],"chorus":"O yes, He cares; I know He cares!\nHis heart is touched with my grief;\nWhen the days are weary, the long nights dreary,\nI know my Savior cares. (He cares.)"}
