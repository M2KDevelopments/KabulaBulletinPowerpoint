Gentle Jesus Meek and Mild","verses":["Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,\nLook upon a little child;\nPity my simplicity,\nSuffer me to come to Thee","Lamb of God, I look to Thee;\nThou shalt my example be;\nThou art gentle, meek and mild;\nThou wast once a little child","Fain I would be as Thou art;\nGive me Thy obedient heart;\nThou art pitiful and kind,\nLet me have Thy loving mind","I shall then show forth Thy praise,\nServe Thee all my happy days;\nThen the world shall always see\nChrist, the Holy Child in me."],"chorus":""}
