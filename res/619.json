{"number":619,"title":"619. Lead On, O King Eternal","verses":["Lead on, O King Eternal,\nThe day of march has come;\nHenceforth in fields of conquest\nThy tents shall be our home;\nThrough days of preparation\nThy grace has made us strong,\nAnd now, O King Eternal,\nWe lift our battle song.","Lead on, O King Eternal,\nTill sin's fierce war shall cease,\nAnd holiness shall whisper\nThe sweet Amen of peace;\nFor not with swords, loud clashing,\nNor roll of stirring drums,\nWith deeds of love and mercy,\nThe heavenly kingdom comes.","Lead on, O King Eternal,\nWe follow, not with fears,\nFor gladness breaks like morning\nWhere'er Thy face appears;\nThy cross is lifted o'er us;\nWe journey in its light;\nThe crown awaits the conquest;\nLead on, O God of might."],"chorus":""}
