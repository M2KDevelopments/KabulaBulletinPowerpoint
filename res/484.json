{"number":484,"title":"484. I Need Thee, Precious Jesus","verses":["I need Thee, precious Jesus,\nFor I am very poor;\nA stranger and a pilgrim,\nI have no earthly store.\nI need the love of Jesus\nTo cheer me on my way,\nTo guide my doubting footsteps,\nTo be my strength and stay.","I need the heart of Jesus\nTo feel each anxious care,\nTo tell my every trial,\nAnd all my sorrows share.\nI need the Holy Spirit\nTo teach me what I am,\nTo show me more of Jesus,\nTo point me to the Lamb.","I need Thee, precious Jesus,\nI hope to see Thee soon,\nEncircled with the rainbow,\nAnd seated on Thy throne.\nThere, with Thy blood-bought children,\nMy joy shall ever be\nTo sing Thy ceaseless praises,\nTo gaze, my Lord, on Thee!"],"chorus":""}
