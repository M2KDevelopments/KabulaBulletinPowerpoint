{"number":383,"title":"383. O Day of Rest and Gladness","verses":["O day of rest and gladness,\nO day of joy and light,\nO balm of care and sadness,\nMost beautiful, most bright;\nOn thee, the high and lowly,\nWho bend before the throne,\nSing, Holy, holy, holy,\nTo the Eternal One.","Thou art a port protected\nFrom storms that round us rise,\nA garden intersected\nWith streams of Paradise;\nThou art a cooling fountain\nIn life's dry, dreary sand;\nFrom thee, like Pisgah's mountain,\nWe view our promised land.","A day of sweet reflection\nThou art, a day of love;\nA day to raise affection\nFrom earth to things above.\nNew graces ever gaining\nFrom this our day of rest,\nWe seek the rest remaining\nIn mansions of the blest."],"chorus":""}
