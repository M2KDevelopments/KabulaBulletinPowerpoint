{"number":73,"title":"73. Holy, Holy, Holy","verses":["Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!\nEarly in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;\nHoly, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!\nGod in three persons, blessed Trinity!","Holy, holy, holy! Angels adore Thee,\nCasting down their bright crowns around the glassy sea;\nThousands and ten thousands worship low before Thee,\nWhich wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.","Holy, holy, holy! Though darkness hide Thee,\nThough the eye of man Thy great glory may not see;\nOnly Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,\nPerfect in power, in love and purity.","Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!\nAll Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth and sky and sea;\nHoly, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!\nGod in three persons, blessed Trinity!"],"chorus":""}
