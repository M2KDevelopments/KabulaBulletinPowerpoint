Blessed is He Whose Transgressions Are Forgiven - Psalm 32  ","number":758,"verses":["Blessed is he whose transgressions\nare forgiven, whose sins are covered.\nBlessed is the man whose sin the\nLord does not count against him\nand in whose spirit is no deceit.\n    ","When I kept silent, my bones wasted\naway through my groaning all day long.\nFor day and night your hand was heavy upon me;\nmy strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.\n    ","Then I acknowledged my sin to you\nand did not cover up my iniquity.\nI said, \"I will confess my transgressions\nto the Lord\" and you forgave the guilt of my sin.\n    ","Therefore let everyone who is godly\npray to you while you may be found;\nsurely when the mighty waters rise,\nthey will not reach him.\nYou are my hiding place; you will protect me\nfrom trouble and surround me with\nsongs of deliverance.\n    ","I will instruct you and teach you\nin the way you should go;\nI will counsel you and watch over you.\n    "]}
