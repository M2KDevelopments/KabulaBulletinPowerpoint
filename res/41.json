O Splendor of God's Glory Bright","verses":["O splendor of God's glory bright,\nFrom light eternal bringing light;\nO Light of life, light's living spring,\nTrue day, all days illumining.","O Thou true Sun, on us Thy glance\nLet fall in royal radiance;\nThe Spirit's sanctifying beam\nUpon our earthly senses stream.","O joyful be the passing day\nWith thoughts as clear as morning's ray,\nWith faith like noontide shining bright,\nOur souls unshadowed by the night.","Dawn's glory gilds the earth and skies;\nLet Him, our perfect morn, arise;\nThe Father's help His children claim,\nAnd sing the Father's glorious name. Amen."],"chorus":""}
