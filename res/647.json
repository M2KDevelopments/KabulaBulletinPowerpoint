{"number":647,"title":"647. Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory","verses":["Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;\nHe is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;\nHe has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;\nHis truth is marching on.","He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;\nHe is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;\nO be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!\nOur God is marching on.","In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,\nWith a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;\nAs He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free!\nWhile God is marching on."],"chorus":"Glory! glory! Hallelujah!\nGlory! glory! Hallelujah!\nGlory! glory! Hallelujah!\nHis truth is marching on."}
