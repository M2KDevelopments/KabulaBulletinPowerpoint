Returning to God - Luke 15  ","number":757,"verses":["[Jesus] said:\n\"There was once a man who had two sons;\nand the younger said to his father,\n'Father, give me my share of the property.'\nSo he divided his estate between them.","\"A few days later the younger son\r\nturned the whole of his share into cash\nand left home for a distant country,\nwhere he squandered it in reckless living.\"","\"He had spent it all,\nwhen a severe famine fell upon that country\nand he began to feel the pinch.\nSo he went and attached himself\nto one of the local landowners,\nwho sent him on to his farm to mind the pigs.","\"He would have been glad to fill his belly\nwith the pods that the pigs were eating;\nand no one gave him anything.","\"Then he came to his senses and said,\n'How many of my father's paid servants\nhave more food than they can eat,\nand here am I, starving to death!","\"'I will set off and go to my father,\nand say to him,\n\"Father, I have sinned, against God\nand against you;\nI am no longer lit to be called your son;\ntreat me as one of your paid servants.\"\nSo he set out for his father's house.","\"But while he was still a long\nway off his father saw him,\nand his heart went out to him.\nHe ran to meet him, flung his arms round him,\nand kissed him.","\"The son said, 'Father, I have sinned,\nagainst God and against you;\nI am no longer lit to be called your son.'","\"But the father said to his servants,\n'Quick! fetch a robe, my best one,\nand put it on him;\nput a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet.\nBring the fatted calf and kill it,\nand let us have a feast to celebrate the day.\nFor this son of mine was dead and\nhas come back to life;\nhe was lost and is found.'","\"And the festivities began.\""]}
