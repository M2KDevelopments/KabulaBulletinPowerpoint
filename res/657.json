{"number":657,"title":"657. O God From Whom Mankind","verses":["O God from whom mankind derives its name;\nWhose covenant of grace remains the same,\nBe with there two who now before You wait;\nEnlarge the love they come to consecrate.","May through their union other lives be blessed;\nTheir door be wide to stranger and to guest,\nGive them the understanding that is kind,\nGrant them the blessing of an open mind.","Preserve their days from inwardness of heart;\nTo each the gift of truthful speech impart.\nTheir bond be strong against all strain and strife\nAmid the changes of this earthly life.","From stage to stage on life's unfolding way\nBring to their mind the vows they make this day,\nYour Spirit be their Guide in every move,\nTheir faith in Christ the basis of their love."],"chorus":""}
