{"number":2,"title":"2. All Creatures of Our God and King","verses":["All creatures of our God and King,\nLift up your voice with us and sing:\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\nO burning sun with golden beam\nAnd silver moon with softer gleam:","O rushing wind and breezes soft,\nO clouds that ride the winds aloft:\nOh, praise Him! Alleluia!\nO rising morn, in praise rejoice,\nO lights of evening, find a voice.","O flowing waters, pure and clear,\nMake music for your Lord to hear.\nOh, praise Him! Alleluia!\nO fire so masterful and bright,\nProviding us with warmth and light,","Let all things their Creator bless,\nAnd worship Him in humbleness,\nOh, praise Him! Alleluia!\nOh, praise the Father, praise the Son,\nAnd praise the Spirit, three in One!"],"chorus":"Oh, praise Him! Oh, praise Him!\nAlleluia, alleluia, alleluia!"}
