{"number":215,"title":"215. The King Shall Come","verses":["The King shall come when morning dawns\nAnd light triumphant breaks,\nWhen beauty gilds the eastern hills\nAnd life to joy awakes.","Not as of old a little child,\nTo bear and fight and die,\nBut crowned with glory like the sun\nThat lights the morning sky.","O, brighter than the rising morn\nWhen Christ, victorious, rose\nAnd left the lonesome place of death,\nDespite the rage of foes.","O, brighter than that glorious morn\nShall dawn upon our race\nThe day when Christ in splendor comes,\nAnd we shall see His face.","The King shall come when morning dawns\nAnd light and beauty brings.\nHail, Christ the Lord! Your people pray:\nCome quickly, King of kings."],"chorus":""}
