Prince of Peace Control My Will","verses":["Prince of Peace, control my will,\nBid this struggling heart be still;\nBid my fears and doubtings cease,\nHush my spirit into peace.","Thou hast bought me with Thy blood,\nOpened wide the gate to God;\nPeace, I ask, but peace must be,\nLord, in being one with Thee.","May Thy will, not mine, be done,\nMay Thy will and mine be one;\nChase these doubtings from my heart,\nNow Thy perfect peace impart."],"chorus":""}
