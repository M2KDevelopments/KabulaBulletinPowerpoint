{"number":155,"title":"155. When I Survey the Wondrous Cross","verses":["When I survey the wondrous cross\nOn which the Prince of glory died,\nMy richest gain I count but loss,\nAnd pour contempt on all my pride.","See, from His head, His hands, His feet,\nSorrow and love flow mingled down;\nDid e'er such love and sorrow meet?\nOr thorns compose so rich a crown?","Since I, who was undone and lost,\nHave pardon through His name and word;\nForbid it, then, that I should boast,\nSave in the cross of Christ my Lord.","Were the whole realm of nature mine,\nThat were a tribute far too small;\nLove so amazing, so divine,\nDemands my life, my soul, my all."],"chorus":""}
