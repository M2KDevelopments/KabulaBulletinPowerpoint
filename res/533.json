{"number":533,"title":"533. O for a Faith","verses":["O for a faith that will not shrink,\nThough pressed by many a foe;\nThat will not tremble on the brink of poverty,\nOf poverty or woe; Of poverty or woe.","That will not murmur or complain\nBeneath the chastening rod,\nBut in the hour of grief or pain, of grief or pain\nCan lean upon its God; Can lean upon its God.","A faith that shines more bright and clear\nWhen tempests rage without;\nThat when in danger knows no fear, knows of no fear,\nIn darkness feels no doubt; In darkness feels no doubt.","That bears unmoved the world's dread frown,\nNor heeds its scornful smile;\nThat sin's wild ocean cannot drown, no, cannot drown,\nNor its soft arts beguile; Nor its soft arts beguile.","Lord, give me such a faith as this,\nAnd then, whate'er may come\nI'll taste e'en here the hallowed bliss, the hallowed bliss\nOf an eternal home; Of an eternal home."],"chorus":""}
