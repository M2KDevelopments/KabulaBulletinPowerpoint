{"number":74,"title":"74. Like a River Glorious","verses":["Like a river glorious\nIs God's perfect peace,\nOver all victorious\nIn its bright increase;\nPerfect, yet it floweth\nFuller every day,\nPerfect, yet it groweth\nDeeper all the way.","Hidden in the hollow\nOf His blessed hand,\nNever foe can follow,\nNever traitor stand;\nNot a surge of worry,\nNot a shade of care,\nNot a blast of hurry\nTouch the spirit there.","Every joy or testing\nComes from God above,\nGiven to His children\nAs an act of love;\nWe may trust Him fully\nAll for us to do;\nThey who trust Him wholly\nFind Him wholly true."],"chorus":"Trusting in Jehovah,\nHearts are fully blest;\nFinding, as He promised,\nPerfect peace and rest."}
