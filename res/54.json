O Gladsome Light","verses":["O gladsome light\nOf God the Father's face,\nThe eternal splendor wearing;\nCelestial, holy, blest,\nOur Savior, Jesus Christ,\nJoyful in Thine appearing.","Now e'er day fadeth quite,\nWe see the ev'ning light,\nOur wonted hymn ourpouring;\nFather of might unknown,\nThee His incarnate Son,\nAnd Holy Spirit adoring.","To Thee of right belongs\nAll praise of holy songs,\nO Son of God, lifegiver;\nThee therefore, O most high,\nThe world doth glorify\nAnd shall exalt for ever."],"chorus":""}
