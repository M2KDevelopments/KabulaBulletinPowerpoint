O Sing a New Song to the Lord","verses":["O sing a new song to the Lord\nFor marvels He has done;\nHis right hand and His holy arm\nThe victory have won.","With harp, with harp and voice of psalms\nUnto Jehovah sing;\nLet trumpets and the echoing horn\nAcclaim the Lord our King!","Let seas with all their creatures roar,\nThe world and dwellers there,\nAnd let the rivers clap their hands,\nThe hills their joy declare.","Before the Lord: because He comes,\nTo judge the earth comes He;\nHe'll judge the world with righteousness,\nHis folk with equity."],"chorus":""}
