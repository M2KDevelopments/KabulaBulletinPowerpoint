{"number":53,"title":"53. All Praise to Thee","verses":["All praise to Thee, my God, this night,\nFor all the blessings of the light!\nKeep me, O keep me, King of kings,\nBeneath Thine own almighty wings.","Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,\nThe ill that I this day have done,\nThat with the world, myself, and Thee,\nI, ere I sleep, at peace may be.","O may my soul on Thee repose;\nAnd with sweet sleep mine eyelids close,\nSleep, that may me more vigorous make\nTo serve my God when I awake.","Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;\nPraise Him, all creatures here below;\nPraise Him above, ye heavenly host;\nPraise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."],"chorus":""}
