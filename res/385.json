Crowning Jewel of Creation","verses":["Crowning jewel of creation,\nBlest and hallowed, sanctified;\nTime and changes all transcending,\nShared forever, glorified.","Sin and sickness, prayer and weeping\nCease at close of earthly days;\nBut Thy Sabbath is eternal,\nJoyful thanks to Thee we raise!","Teach us Lord, in storm or sunshine\nHow to truly rest in Thee,\nMay Thy Sabbath peace enfold us\nAnd our shelter ever be."],"chorus":"Blessed Sabbath made for man,\nGift from the Creator's hand."}
