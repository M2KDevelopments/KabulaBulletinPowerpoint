God Be With You","verses":["God be with you till we meet again;\nBy His counsels guide, uphold you,\nWith His sheep securely fold you:\nGod be with you till we meet again.","God be with you till we meet again;\nNeath His wings securely hide you,\nDaily manna still provide you:\nGod be with you till we meet again.","God be with you till we meet again;\nWhen life's perils thick confound you,\nPut His arms unfailing round you:\nGod be with you till we meet again.","God be with you till we meet again;\nKeep love's banner floating o'er you,\nSmite death's threatening wave before you:\nGod be with you till we meet again."],"chorus":""}
