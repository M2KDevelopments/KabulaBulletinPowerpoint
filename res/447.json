{"number":447,"title":"447. Long Upon the Mountains","verses":["Long upon the mountains weary,\nHave the scattered flock been torn;\nDark the desert paths, and dreary;\nGrievous trials have they borne.\nNow the gathering call is sounding,\nSolemn in its warning voice;\nUnion, faith, and love, abounding,\nBid the little flock rejoice.","Now the light of truth they're seeking,\nIn its onward track pursue;\nAll the ten commandments keeping,\nThey are holy, just, and true.\nOn the words of life they're feeding,\nPrecious to their taste so sweet;\nAll their Master's precepts heeding,\nBowing humbly at His feet.","In that light of light and beauty,\nIn that golden city fair,\nSoon its pearly gates they'll enter,\nAnd of all its glories share.\nThere, divine the soul's expansions;\nFree from sin, and death, and pain;\nTears will never dim those mansions\nWhere the saints immortal reign.","Soon He comes! with clouds descending;\nAll His saints, entombed arise;\nThe redeemed, in anthems blending,\nShout their vict'ry thro' the skies.\nO, we long for Thine appearing;\nCome, O Savior, quickly come!\nBlessed hope! our spirits cheering,\nTake Thy ransomed children home."],"chorus":""}
