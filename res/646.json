To the Name That Brings Salvation","verses":["To the name that brings salvation\nLet the nations bow the head;\nLet them kneel in adoration\nWhen this name of names is said;\nLet them pray for restoration\nOf all things in Christ the head.","He through every generation\nRules in endless majesty;\nMay the kings of every nation\nNow foreswear their enmity,\nAnd with humble veneration\nIn the love of God agree.","Lord, we pray for upright rulers:\nGuard them surely in their need\nFrom the vanity of power\nAnd the emptiness of greed;\nLet them see the truth of lowness,\nAnd on justice let them feed."],"chorus":""}
