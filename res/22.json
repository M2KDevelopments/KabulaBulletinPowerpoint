{"number":22,"title":"22. God Is Our Song","verses":["God is our Song, and every singer blest\nWho praising Him finds energy and rest.\nAll who praise God with unaffected joy\nGive back to us the wisdom we destroy,\nGive back to us the wisdom we destroy.","God is our Song, for Jesus comes to save;\nWhile praising Him we offer all we have.\nNew songs we sing, in ventures new unite,\nWhen Jesus leads us upward into light,\nWhen Jesus leads us upward into light.","This is the Song no conflict ever drowns;\nWho praises God our human wrath disowns.\nLove knows what rich complexities of sound\nGod builds upon a simple common ground,\nGod builds upon a simple common ground.","God is our Silence when no songs are sung,\r\nWhen ecstasy or sorrow stills the tongue.\nGlorious the faith which silently obeys\nUntil we find again the voice of praise,\nUntil we find again the voice of praise."],"chorus":""}
