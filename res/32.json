{"number":32,"title":"32. When in Our Music God Is Glorified","verses":["When in our music God is glorified,\nAnd adoration leaves no room for pride,\nIt is as though the whole creation cried:\nAlleluia!","How oft, in making music, we have found\nA new dimension in the world of sound,\nAs worship moved us to a more profound\nAlleluia!","And did not Jesus sing a psalm that night\nWhen utmost evil strove against the light?\nThen let us sing for whom He won the fight:\nAlleluia!","Let every instrument be used for praise;\nLet all rejoice who have a voice to raise;\nAnd may God give us faith to sing always:\nAlleluia!"],"chorus":""}
