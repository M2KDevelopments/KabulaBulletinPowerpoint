{"number":118,"title":"118. The First Noel","verses":["The first noel the angel did say\nWas to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;\nIn fields where they lay keeping their sheep,\nOn a cold winter's night that was so deep.","They looked up and saw a star\nShining in the east, beyond them far,\nAnd to the earth it gave great light,\nAnd so it continued both day and night.","And by the light of that same star,\nThree wise men came from country far;\nTo seek for a king was their intent,\nAnd to follow the star wherever it went.","This star drew nigh to the northwest,\nO'er Bethlehem it took its rest,\nAnd there it did both stop and stay,\nRight over the place where Jesus lay.","Then entered in those wise men three,\nFull reverently upon the knee,\nAnd offered there, in His presence,\nTheir gold, and myrrh, and frankincense."],"chorus":"Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,\nBorn is the King of Israel."}
