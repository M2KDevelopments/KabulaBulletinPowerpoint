{"number":345,"title":"345. Christ Is the World's True Light","verses":["Christ is the world's true light,\nIts captain of salvation,\nThe daystar clear and bright\nOf every man and nation;\nNew life, new hope awakes\nWhere'er men own His sway:\nFreedom her bondage breaks,\nAnd night is turned to day.","In Christ all races meet,\nTheir ancient feuds forgetting,\nThe whole round world complete,\nFrom sunrise to its setting:\nWhen Christ is throned as Lord,\nMen shall forsake their fear,\nTo plowshare beat the sword,\nTo pruning hook the spear.","One Lord, in one great name\nUnite us all who own Thee,\nCast out our pride and shame\nThat hinder to enthrone Thee;\nThe world has waited long,\nHas travailed long in pain,\nTo heal its ancient wrong,\nCome, Prince of Peace, and reign."],"chorus":""}
