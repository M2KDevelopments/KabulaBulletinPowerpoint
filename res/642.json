{"number":642,"title":"642. We Praise Thee With Our Minds","verses":["We praise Thee with our minds, O Lord,\nKept sharp to think Thy thought;\nCome, Holy Ghost with grace outpoured,\nTo teach what Christ hath taught.\nIn all our learning may we seek\nThat wisdom from above\nWhich comes to all: the brave, the meek,\nWho ask in faith and love.","We praise Thee thro' our bodies, Lord,\nKept strong to do Thy will;\nThy Spirit's temples, which afford\nA means to praise Thee still.\nWe give ourselves, a sacrifice,\nTo live as unto Thee;\nFor Thou alone hast paid the price\nTo bring salvation free.","We praise Thee in our hearts, O King,\nKept pure to know Thy ways;\nAnd raise to Thee a hymn to sing\r\nEternally Thy praise.\nAltho adoring hearts will bow\r\nAs age on ages roll;\nWe praise Thee in our beings now,\nMind, body, heart, and soul."],"chorus":""}
