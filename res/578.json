{"number":578,"title":"578. So Send I You","verses":["So send I you-by grace made strong to triumph\nO'er hosts of hell, o'er darkness, death, and sin,\nMy name to bear, and in that name to conquer-\nSo send I you, My victory to win.","So send I you-to take to souls in bondage\nThe word of truth that sets the captive free,\nTo break the bonds of sin, to loose death's fetters-\nSo send I you, to bring the lost to Me.","So send I you - My strength to know in weakness,\nMy joy in grief, My perfect peace in pain,\nTo prove My power, My grace, My promised presence-\nSo send I you, eternal fruit to gain.","So send I you-to bear My cross with patience,\nAnd then one day with joy to lay it down,\nTo hear My voice, \"Well done, My faithful servant-\nCome, share My throne, My kingdom, and My crown!\"\n\"As the Father hath sent Me, so send I you.\""],"chorus":""}
