{"number":272,"title":"272. Give Me the Bible","verses":["Give me the Bible, star of gladness gleaming,\nTo cheer the wanderer lone and tempest tossed,\nNo storm can hide that peaceful radiance beaming,\nSince Jesus came to seek and save the lost.","Give me the Bible when my heart is broken,\nWhen sin and grief have filled my soul with fear;\nGive me the precious words by Jesus spoken,\nHold up faith's lamp to show my Savior near.","Give me the Bible, all my steps enlighten,\nTeach me the danger of these realms below;\nThat lamp of safety, o'er the gloom shall brighten,\nThat light alone the path of peace can show."],"chorus":"Give me the Bible; holy message shining,\nThy light shall guide me in the narrow way.\nPrecept and promise, law and love combining,\n'Till night shall vanish in eternal day."}
