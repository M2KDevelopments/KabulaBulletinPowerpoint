{"number":92,"title":"92. This Is My Father's World","verses":["This is my Father's world,\nAnd to my listening ears,\nAll nature sings, and round me rings\nThe music of the spheres.\nThis is my Father's world;\nI rest me in the thought\nOf rocks and trees, of skies and seas;\nHis hand the wonders wrought.","This is my Father's world,\nThe birds their carols raise;\nThe morning light, the lily white,\nDeclare their Maker's praise.\nThis is my Father's world;\nHe shines in all that's fair;\nIn the rustling grass I hear Him pass,\nHe speaks to me everywhere.","This is my Father's world,\nO let me ne'er forget\nThat though the wrong seems oft so strong,\nGod is the Ruler yet.\nThis is my Father's world;\nWhy should my heart be sad?\nThe Lord is King; let the heavens ring!\nGod reigns; let the earth be glad."],"chorus":""}
