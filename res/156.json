O Sacred Head Now Wounded","verses":["O sacred head, now wounded,\nWith grief and shame weighed down,\nNow scornfully surrounded\nWith thorns, Thine only crown:\nO sacred head, what glory,\nWhat bliss till now was Thine!\nYet, though despised and gory,\nI joy to call Thee mine.","What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered\nWas all for sinners' gain;\nMine, mine was the transgression,\nBut Thine the deadly pain.\nLo, here I fall, my Savior!\n'Tis I deserve Thy place;\nLook on me with Thy favor,\nVouchsafe to me Thy grace.","What language shall I borrow\nTo thank Thee, dearest friend,\nFor this Thy dying sorrow,\nThy pity without end?\nO make me Thine forever;\nAnd should I fainting be,\nLord, let me never, never\nOutlive my love to Thee."],"chorus":""}
