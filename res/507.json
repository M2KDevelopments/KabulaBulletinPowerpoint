Moment by Moment","verses":["Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine,\nLiving with Jesus, a new life divine,\nLooking to Jesus till glory doth shine,\nMoment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.","Never a trial that He is not there,\nNever a burden that He doth not bear,\nNever a sorrow that He doth not share,\nMoment by moment I'm under His care.","Never a heartache, and never a groan,\nNever a teardrop and never a moan;\nNever a danger but there on the throne,\nMoment by moment He thinks of His own.","Never a weakness that He doth not feel,\nNever a sickness that He cannot heal;\nMoment by moment, in woe or in weal,\nJesus, my Savior, abides with me still."],"chorus":"Moment by moment I'm kept in His love;\nMoment by moment I've life from above;\nLooking to Jesus till glory doth shine;\nMoment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine."}
