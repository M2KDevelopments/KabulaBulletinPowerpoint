{"number":558,"title":"558. For the Fruits of His Creation","verses":["For the fruits of His creation, thanks be to God;\nFor the gifts to every nation, thanks be to god;\nFor the plowing, sowing, reaping,\nSilent growth while men are sleeping,\nFuture needs in earth's safe keeping, thanks be to God!","In the just reward of labor, God's will is done;\nIn the help we give our neighbor, God's will is done;\nIn our world-wide task of caring\nFor the hungry and despairing,\nIn the harvests men are sharing, God's will is done.","For the harvests of His Spirit, thanks be to God;\nFor the good all men inherit, thanks be to God;\nFor the wonders that astound us,\nFor the truths that still confound us,\nMost of all, that love has found us, thanks be to God!"],"chorus":""}
