{"number":280,"title":"280. Come, Ye Sinners","verses":["Come, ye sinners poor and needy,\r\nWeak and wounded, sick and sore;\r\nJesus ready stands to save you,\r\nFull of pity, love, and power.","Come, ye thirsty, come, and welcome,\r\nGod's free bounty glorify;\r\nTrue belief and true repentance,\r\nEvery grace that brings you nigh.","Let not conscience make you linger,\r\nNor of fitness fondly dream;\r\nAll the fitness He requireth\r\nIs to feel your need of Him.","Lo! th' incarnate God, ascended,\r\nPleads the merit of His blood;\r\nVenture on Him, venture wholly,\r\nLet no other trust intrude."],"chorus":"I will arise and go to Jesus,\nHe will embrace me in His arms;\nIn the arms of my dear Savior,\nO there are ten thousand charms."}
