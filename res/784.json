Blessed is the Man - Psalm 1  ","number":784,"verses":["Blessed is the man who walks not\nin the counsel of the wicked,\nnor stands in the way of sinners,\nnor sits in the seat of scoffers;\n    ","but his delight is in the law of the Lord,\nand on his law he meditates day and night.\n    ","He is like a tree planted by streams of water,\nthat yields its fruit in its season,\nand its leaf does not wither.\nIn all that he does, he prospers.\n    ","The wicked are not so,\nbut are like chaff which the wind drives away.\n    ","Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,\nnor sinners in the congregation or the righteous;\n    ","for the Lord knows the way of the righteous,\nbut the way of the wicked will perish.\n    "]}
