{"number":638,"title":"638. The Wise May Bring Their Learning","verses":["The wise may bring their learning,\nThe rich may bring their wealth,\nAnd some may bring their greatness,\nAnd some their strength and health:\nWe too would bring our treasures\nTo offer to the King,\nWe have no wealth or learning-\nWhat shall we children bring?","We'll bring Him hearts that love Him,\nWe'll bring Him thankful praise,\nAnd young souls meekly striving\nTo follow in His ways:\nAnd these be the treasures\nWe offer to the King,\nAnd these are gifts that ever\nThe poorest child may bring.","We'll bring the little duties\nWe have to do each day;\nWe'll try our best to please Him\nAt home, at school, at play:\nAnd better are these treasures\nTo offer to the King\nThan richest gift without them:\nYet these a child may bring."],"chorus":""}
