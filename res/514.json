Lord of Our Life","verses":["Lord of our life, and God of our salvation,\nStar of our night, and hope of every nation,\nHear and receive Thy church's supplication,\nLord God Almighty.","Lord, Thou canst help when earthly armor faileth;\nLord, Thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth;\nLord, o'er Thy rock nor death nor hell prevaileth;\nGrant us Thy peace, Lord.","Peace in our hearts our evil thoughts assuaging;\nPeace in Thy church, where brothers are engaging;\nPeace, when the world its busy war is waging;\nSend us, O Savior.","Grant us Thy help till foes are backward driven;\nGrant them Thy truth that they may be forgiven;\nGrant peace on earth, and, after we have striven,\nPeace in Thy heaven."],"chorus":""}
