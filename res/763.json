Sanctification - 1 Corinthians 6, Hebrews 2, Titus 3  ","number":763,"verses":["Do you not know that the wicked will\nnot inherit the kingdom of God?\nDo not be deceived:","Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters\nnor adulterers nor male prostitutes\nnor homosexual offenders nor thieves\nnor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers\nnor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.","And that is what some of you were.\nBut you were washed, you were sanctified,\nYou were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ\nand by the Spirit of our God.","Both the one who makes men holy and those who are\nmade holy are of the same family.\nSo Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.","Remind the people to be subject to rulers\nand authorities, to be obedient,\nto be ready to do whatever is good,\nto slander no one,\nto be peaceable and considerate,\nand to show true humility toward all men.","At one time we too were foolish, disobedient,\ndeceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions\nand pleasures.\nWe lived in malice and envy,\nbeing hated and hating one another.","But when the kindness and love of God our Savior\n'appeared, he saved us, not because of\nrighteous things we had done,\nbut because of his mercy.","He saved us through the washing of rebirth\nand renewal by the Holy Spirit,\nwhom he poured out on us generously\nthrough Jesus Christ our Savior, so that,\nhaving been justified by his grace,\r\nwe might become heirs\nhaving the hope of eternal life."]}
