My Song Shall Be of Jesus","verses":["My song shall be of Jesus,\nHis mercy crowns my days,\nHe fills my cup with blessings,\nAnd tunes my heart to praise;\nMy song shall be of Jesus,\nThe precious Lamb of God,\nWho gave Himself my ransom,\nAnd bought me with His blood.","My song shall be of Jesus,\nWhen sitting at His feet,\nI call to mind His goodness\nAnd know my joy's complete;\nMy song shall be of Jesus,\nWhatever ills befall,\nI'll sing the grace that saves me,\nAnd triumphs over all.","My song shall be of Jesus,\nWhile pressing on my way\nTo where my home shines glorious\nIn pure and perfect day.\nAnd when my soul shall enter\nThe many mansions fair,\nA song of praise to Jesus\nI'll sing forever there."],"chorus":""}
