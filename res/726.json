The Lord is My Shepherd - Psalm 23  ","number":726,"verses":["The Lord is my shepherd;\nI shall not want.","He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:\nhe leadeth me beside the still waters.","He restoreth my soul:\nhe leadeth me in the paths of righteousness\nfor his name's sake.","Yea, though I walk through the\nvalley of the shadow of death,\nI will fear no evil:\nfor thou art with me;\nthy rod and thy staff they comfort me.","Thou preparest a table before me\nin the presence of mine enemies:\nthou anointest my head with oil;\nmy cup runneth over.","Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me\nall the days of my life:\nand I will dwell in the house of the\nLord for ever."]}
