{"number":332,"title":"332. The Cleansing Wave","verses":["O now I see the crimson wave,\nThe fountain deep and wide;\nJesus, my Lord, mighty to save,\nPoints to His wounded side.","I see the new creation rise,\nI hear the speaking blood;\nIt speaks; polluted nature dies,\nSinks 'neath the cleansing flood.","I rise to walk in heaven's own light,\nAbove the world and sin;\nWith heart made pure and garments white,\nAnd Christ enthroned within.","Amazing grace! 'tis heaven below\nTo feel the blood applied,\nAnd Jesus, only Jesus, know,\nMy Jesus crucified."],"chorus":"The cleansing stream I see, I see,\nI plunge, and O, it cleanseth me!\nO praise the Lord! it cleanseth me,\nIt cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me."}
