It Took A Miracle","verses":["My Father is omnipotent,\nAnd that you can't deny;\nA God of might and miracles;\n'Tis written in the sky.","Though here His glory has been shown,\nWe still can't fully see\nThe wonders of His might, His throne;\n'Twill take eternity.","The Bible tells us of His power\nAnd wisdom all way through,\nAnd every little bird and flower\nAre testimonies, too."],"chorus":"It took a miracle to put the stars in place,\nIt took a miracle to hang the world in space;\r\nBut when He saved my soul,\nCleansed and made me whole,\nIt took a miracle of love and grace!"}
