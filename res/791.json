{"title":"791. Set Your Mind on God's Kingdom - Matthew 6  ","number":791,"verses":["\"No servant can be the slave of two masters;\nfor either he will hate the first and love the second,\nor he will be devoted to the first and\nthink nothing of the second.\nYou cannot serve God and Money.\n    ","\"Therefore I bid you put away anxious thoughts\nabout food and drink to keep you alive,\nand clothes to cover your body.\nSurely life is more than food,\nthe body more than clothes.\n    ","\"Look at the birds of the air;\nthey do not sow and reap and store in barns,\nyet your heavenly Father feeds them.\nYou are worth more than the birds!\n    ","\"Is there a man of you who by anxious\nthought can add a foot to his height?\nAnd why be anxious about clothes?\n    ","\"Consider how the lilies grow in the fields;\nthey do not work, they do not spin; and yet,\r\nI tell you, even Solomon in all his splendour\nwas not attired like one of these.\n    ","\"But if that is how God clothes the\ngrass in the fields, which is there today,\nand tomorrow is thrown on the stove,\nwill he not all the more clothe you?\n    ","\"How little faith you have!\nNo, do not ask anxiously,\n'What are we to eat? What are we to drink?\nWhat shall we wear?'\"\n    ","All these are things for the heathen to run after,\nnot for you, because your heavenly Father\nknows that you need them all.\n    ","\"Set your mind on God's kingdom and his\r\njustice before every thing else,\nand all the rest will come to you as well.\"\n    "]}
