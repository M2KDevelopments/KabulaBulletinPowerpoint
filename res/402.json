By Christ Redeemed","verses":["By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored,\r\nWe keep the memory adored,\nAnd show the death of our dear Lord,\nUntil He come.","His broken body in our\nstead Is here, in this memorial bread;\nAnd so our feeble love is fed,\nUntil He come.","His fearful drops of agony,\nHis lifeblood shed for us we see;\nThe wine shall tell the mystery,\nUntil He come.","And thus that dark betrayal night,\nWith the last advent we unite-\nThe shame, the glory, by this rite,\nUntil He come."],"chorus":""}
