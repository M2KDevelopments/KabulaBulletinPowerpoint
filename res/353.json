Father Help Your People","verses":["Father, help Your people in this world to build\nSomething of Your kingdom and to do Your will,\nLead us to discover partnership in love;\nBless our ways of sharing and our pride remove.","Lord of desk and altar, bind our lives in one,\nThat in work and worship love may set the tone.\nGive us grace to listen, clarity of speech;\nMake us truly thankful for the gifts of each.","Holy is the setting of each room and yard,\nLecture hall and kitchen, office, shop, and ward.\nHoly is the rhythm of our working hours;\nHallow then our purpose, energy, and pow'rs.","Strengthen, Lord, for service hand and heart and brain;\nHelp us good relations daily to maintain.\nLet the living presence of the servant Christ\nHeighten our devotion, make our life a feast."],"chorus":""}
