{"title":"739. Christ's Priesthood - Hebrews 8, 9  ","number":739,"verses":["Now the point in what we are saying is this:\nwe have such a high priest,\none who is seated at the right hand\r\nof the throne of the Majesty in heaven,\na minister in the sanctuary and the true tent\nwhich is set up not by man but by the Lord.","For every high priest is appointed\r\nto offer gifts and sacrifices;\nhence it is necessary for this priest also\nto have something to offer.","Now if he were on earth,\nhe would not be a priest at all,\nsince there are priests\nwho offer gifts according to the law.","But when Christ appeared as a high priest\nof the good things that have come,\nthen through the greater and more perfect tent\n(not made with hands, that is, not of this creation)\nhe entered once for all into the Holy Place,\ntaking not the blood of goats and\ncalves but his own blood,\nthus securing an eternal redemption.","For Christ has entered,\nnot into a sanctuary made with hands,\r\na copy of the true one, but into heaven itself,\nnow to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.","Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly,\nas the high priest enters the Holy Place\nyearly with blood not his own;\r\nfor then he would have had to suffer repeatedly\nsince the foundation of the world.","But as it is, he has appeared\nonce for all at the end of the age\nto put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.","And just as it is appointed for men to die once,\nand after that comes judgment, so Christ,\nhaving been offered once to bear the sins of many,\nwill appear a second time,\nnot to deal with sin but to save those\nwho are eagerly waiting for him."]}
