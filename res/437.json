I'm Going Home","verses":["My heav'nly home is bright and fair,\nNor pain nor death can enter there;\nIts glitt'ring tow'rs the sun outshine,\nThat heav'nly mansion shall be mine.","My Father's house is built on high,\nFar, far above the starry sky;\nWhen from this earthly prison free,\nThat heav'nly mansion mine shall be.","Let others seek a home below,\nWhich flames devour or waves o'erflow;\nBe mine a happier lot to own\nA heav'nly mansion near the throne."],"chorus":"I'm going home, I'm going home,\nI'm going home to die no more;\nTo die no more; to die no more;\nI'm going home to die no more."}
