Joy to the World!","verses":["Joy to the world, the Lord is come!\nLet earth receive her King;\nLet every heart prepare Him room,\nAnd heaven and nature sing,\nAnd heaven and nature sing,\nAnd heaven, and heaven and nature sing.","Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns!\nLet men their songs employ;\nWhile fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains,\nRepeat the sounding joy,\nRepeat the sounding joy,\nRepeat, repeat the sounding joy.","No more let sin and sorrow grow,\nNor thorns infest the ground;\nHe comes to make His blessings flow\nFar as the curse is found,\nFar as the curse is found,\nFar as, far as the curse is found.","He rules the world with truth and grace,\nAnd makes the nations prove\nThe glories of His righteousness,\nAnd wonders of His love,\nAnd wonders of His love,\nAnd wonders, and wonders of His love."],"chorus":""}
