Doing Good to All - Galatians 6  ","number":808,"verses":["\n      Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin,\nyou who are spiritual should restore him gently.\nBut watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.\n    ","\n      Carry each other's burdens, and in this way\nyou will fulfill the law of Christ.\n    ","\n      If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing,\nhe deceives himself.\nEach one should test his own actions.\nThen he can take pride in himself,\nwithout comparing himself to some body else,\nfor each one should carry his own load.\n    ","\n      Anyone who receives instruction in the word\nmust share all good things with his instructor.\n    ","\n      Do not be deceived:\nGod cannot be mocked.\nA man reaps what he sows.\n    ","\n      The one who sows to please his sinful nature,\nfrom that nature will reap destruction;\nthe one who sows to please the Spirit,\nfrom the Spirit will reap eternal life.\n    ","\n      Let us not become weary in doing good,\nfor at the proper time we will reap a\r\nharvest if we do not give up.\n    ","\n      Therefore, as we have opportunity,\nlet us do good to all people,\nespecially to those who belong\nto the family of believers.\n    "]}
