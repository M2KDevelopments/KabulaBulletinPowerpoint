{"number":312,"title":"312. Near the Cross","verses":["Jesus, keep me near the cross;\nThere a precious fountain\nFree to all, a healing stream,\nFlows from Calvary's mountain.","Near the cross, a trembling soul,\nLove and mercy found me;\nThere the bright and Morning Star\nSheds its beams around me.","Near the cross! O Lamb of God,\nBring its scenes before me;\nHelp me walk from day to day,\nWith its shadows o'er me.","Near the cross I'll watch and wait,\nHoping, trusting ever,\nTill I reach the golden strand,\nJust beyond the river."],"chorus":"In the cross, in the cross,\nBe my glory ever,\nTill my raptured soul shall find\nRest beyond the river."}
