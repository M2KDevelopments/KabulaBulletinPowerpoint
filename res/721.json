{"title":"721. Lord, You Have Been Our Refuge - Psalm 90  ","number":721,"verses":["Lord, you have been our refuge age after age.","Before the mountains were born\r\nbefore the earth or the world came to birth,\nyou were God from all eternity and for ever.","You can turn man back into dust by saying,\n\"Back to what you were, you sons of men!\"\nTo you, a thousand years are a single day,\na yesterday now over, an hour of the night.","You brush men away like waking dreams,\nthey are like grass sprouting and flowering\nin the morning,\nwithered and dry before dusk.","We too are burnt up by your anger\nand terrified by your fury;\nhaving summoned up our sins\nyou inspect our secrets by your own light.","Our days dwindle under your wrath,\nour lives are over in a breath\n-our life lasts for seventy years,\neighty with good health,","but they all add up to anxiety and trouble\nover in a trice, and then we are gone.\nWho yet has felt the full force of your fury,\nor learnt to fear the violence of your rage?","Teach us to count how few days we have\nand so gain wisdom of heart."]}
