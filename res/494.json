{"number":494,"title":"494. We Would See Jesus","verses":["\"We would see Jesus;\" for the shadows lengthen\nAcross the little landscape of our life;\nWe would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen\nFor the last conflict, in this mortal strife.","\"We would see Jesus,\" Rock of our salvation,\nWhereon our feet were set with sovereign grace;\nNot life, nor death, with all their agitation,\nCan thence remove us, gazing on His face.","\"We would see Jesus;\" other lights are paling,\nWhich for long years we did rejoice to see;\nThe blessings of this sinful world are failing;\nWe would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee.","\"We would see Jesus;\" this is all we're needing;\nStrength, joy, and willingness come with the sight;\nWe would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading,\nSoon to return and end this mortal night!"],"chorus":""}
