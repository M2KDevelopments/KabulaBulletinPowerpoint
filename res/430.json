{"number":430,"title":"430. Joy By and By","verses":["O there'll be joy when the work is done,\nJoy when the reapers gather home,\nBringing the sheaves at set of sun\nTo the New Jerusalem.","Sweet are the songs that we hope to sing,\nGrateful the thanks our hearts shall bring,\nPraising forever Christ our King\nIn the New Jerusalem.","Pure are the joys that await us there,\nMany the golden mansions fair;\nJesus Himself doth them prepare,\nIn the New Jerusalem."],"chorus":"Joy, joy, there'll be joy by and by,\nJoy, joy, where the joys never die;\nJoy, joy; for the day draweth nigh\nWhen the workers gather home."}
