Christ Is Coming","verses":["Christ is coming! let creation\nBid her groans and travail cease;\nLet the glorious proclamation\nHope restore and faith increase;\nChrist is coming! Christ is coming!\nCome, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!\nCome, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!","Earth can now but tell the story\nOf Thy bitter cross and pain;\nShe shall yet behold Thy glory\nWhen Thou comest back to reign;\nChrist is coming! Christ is coming!\nLet each heart repeat the strain.\nLet each heart repeat the strain.","With that \"blessed hope\" before us,\nLet no harp remain unstrung;\nLet the mighty advent chorus\nOnward roll from tongue to tongue:\nChrist is coming! Christ is coming!\nCome, Lord Jesus, quickly come!\nCome, Lord Jesus, quickly come!"],"chorus":""}
