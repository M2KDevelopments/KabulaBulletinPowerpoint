Give to Our God Immortal Praise","verses":["Give to our God immortal praise;\nMercy and truth are all His ways:\nWonders of grace to God belong,\nRepeat His mercies in your song.","Give to the Lord of lords renown,\nThe King of kings with glory crown:\nHis mercies ever shall endure\nWhen lords and kings are known no more.","He sent His Son with power to save\nFrom guilt and darkness and the grave:\nWonders of grace to God be long,\nRepeat His mercies in your song.","Thro' this vain world He guides our feet,\nAnd leads us to His heav'nly seat:\nHis mercies ever shall endure,\nWhen this vain world shall be no more."],"chorus":""}
