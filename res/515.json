{"number":515,"title":"515. The Lord Is My Light","verses":["The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?\nBy day and by night His presence is near;\nHe is my salvation from sorrow and sin;\nThis blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.","The Lord is my light; though clouds may arise,\nFaith, stronger than sight, looks up to the skies\nWhere Jesus forever in glory doth reign:\nThen how can I ever in darkness remain?","The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength;\nI know in His might I'll conquer at length;\nMy weakness in mercy He covers with power,\nAnd, walking by faith, He upholds me each hour.","The Lord is my light, my all and in all;\nThere is in His sight no darkness at all;\nHe is my Redeemer, my Savior and King;\nWith saints and with angels His praises I sing."],"chorus":"The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;\nBy day and by night He leads me along;\nThe Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;\nBy day and by night He leads me along."}
