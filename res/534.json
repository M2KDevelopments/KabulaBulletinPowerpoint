{"number":534,"title":"534. Will Your Anchor Hold?","verses":["Will your anchor hold in the storm of life,\nWhen the clouds unfold their wings of strife?\nWhen the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,\nWill your anchor drift, or firm remain?","If 'tis safely moored, 'twill the storm withstand,\nFor 'tis well secured by the Savior's hand;\nAnd the cables, passed from His heart to thine,\nCan defy the blast, through strength divine.","It will firmly hold in the straits of Fear,\nWhen the breakers tell that the reef is near;\nThough the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,\nNot an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow.","It will surely hold in the floods of death,\nWhen the waters cold chill our latest breath;\nOn the rising tide it can never fail,\nWhile our hopes abide within the veil.","When our eyes behold, in the dawning light,\nShining gates of pearl, our harbor bright,\nWe shall anchor fast to the heavenly shore,\nWith the storms all past forevermore."],"chorus":"We have an anchor that keeps the soul\nSteadfast and sure while the billows roll;\nFastened to the Rock which cannot move,\nGrounded firm and deep in the Savior's love."}
