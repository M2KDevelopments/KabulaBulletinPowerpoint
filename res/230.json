All Glory, Laud, and Honor","verses":["All glory, laud, and honor\nTo Thee, Redeemer, King,\nTo whom the lips of children\nMade sweet hosannas ring.\nThou art the King of Israel,\nThou, David's royal Son,\nWho in the Lord's name comest,\nThe King and Blessed One.","The company of angels\nAre praising Thee on high,\nAnd mortal men and all things\nCreated make reply.\nThe people of the Hebrews\nWith palms before Thee went;\nOur praise and prayer and anthems\nBefore Thee we present.","To Thee, before Thy passion,\nThey sang their hymns of praise;\nTo Thee, now high exalted,\nOur melody we raise.\nThou didst accept their praises;\nAccept the praise we bring,\nWho in all good delightest,\nThou good and gracious King."],"chorus":""}
