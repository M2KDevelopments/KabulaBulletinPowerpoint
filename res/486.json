{"number":486,"title":"486. I Do Believe","verses":["Father, I stretch my hands to Thee;\nNo other help I know;\nIf Thou withdraw Thyself from me,\nAh, whither shall I go?","On Thy dear Son I now believe,\nO let me feel Thy power;\nAnd all my varied wants relieve,\nIn this accepted hour.","Author of faith! to Thee I lift\nMy weary, longing eyes;\nO let me now receive that gift;\nMy soul without it dies.","Surely Thou canst not let me die;\nO speak, and I shall live;\nAnd here I will unwearied lie,\nTill Thou Thy Spirit give.","How would my fainting soul rejoice\nCould I but see Thy face!\nNow let me hear Thy quickening voice,\nAnd taste Thy pardoning grace.","I do believe, I now believe\nThat Jesus died for me,\nAnd that He shed His precious blood\nFrom sin to set me free."],"chorus":""}
