{"number":460,"title":"460. As Water to the Thirsty","verses":["As water to the thirsty,\nAs beauty to the eyes,\nAs strength that follows weakness,\nAs truth instead of lies;\nAs song-time and springtime\nAnd summertime to be,\nSo is my Lord, my living Lord,\nSo is my Lord to me.","Like calm in place of clamor\nLike peace that follows pain,\nLike meeting after parting,\nLike sunshine after rain;\nLike moonlight and starlight\nAnd sunlight on the sea,\nSo is my Lord, my living Lord,\nSo is my Lord to me.","As sleep that follows fever,\nAs gold instead of grey,\nAs freedom after bondage,\nAs sunrise to the day;\nAs home to the trav'ler\nAnd all he longs to see,\nSo is my Lord, my Living Lord,\nSo is my Lord to me."],"chorus":""}
