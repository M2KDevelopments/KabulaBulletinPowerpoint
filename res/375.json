{"number":375,"title":"375. Work For the Night Is Coming","verses":["Work, for the night is coming;\nWork through the morning hours;\nWork while the dew is sparkling;\nWork 'mid springing flowers;\nWork while the day grows brighter,\nUnder the glowing sun;\nWork, for the night is coming,\nWhen man's work is done.","Work, for the night is coming;\nWork through the sunny noon;\nFill brightest hours with labor,\nRest comes sure and soon;\nGive every flying minute\nSomething to keep in store;\nWork, for the night is coming,\nWhen man works no more.","Work, for the night is coming:\nUnder the sunset skies,\nWhile their bright tints are glowing,\nWork for the daylight flies;\nWork till the last beam fadeth,\nFadeth to shine no more;\nWork, for the Lord is coming,\nWhen man's work is o'er."],"chorus":""}
