{"number":407,"title":"407. Sent Forth By God's Blessing","verses":["Sent forth by God's blessing, Our true faith confessing,\nThe people of God from His dwelling take leave.\nThe supper is ended. Oh, now be extended\nThe fruits of this service in all who believe.\nThe seed of His teaching, Receptive souls reaching,\nShall blossom in action for God and for all.\nHis grace did invite us, His love shall unite us\nTo work for God's kingdom and answer His call.","With praise and thanksgiving To God ever-living,\nThe tasks of our everyday life we will face.\nOur faith ever sharing, In love ever caring,\nEmbracing His children of each tribe and race.\nWith Your feast You feed us, With Your light now lead us;\nUnite us as one in this life that we share.\nThen may all the living With praise and thanksgiving\nGive honor to Christ and His name that we bear."],"chorus":""}
