{"number":617,"title":"617. We Are Living, We Are Dwelling","verses":["We are living, we are dwelling,\nIn a grand and awful time,\nIn an age on ages telling\nTo be living is sublime.\nHark! the waking up of nations,\nGog and Magog to the fray;\nHark! what soundeth? Is creation\nGroaning for her latter day?","Christian, rouse and arm for conflict,\nNerve thee for the battlefield;\nBear the helmet of salvation,\nAnd the mighty gospel shield;\nLet the breastplate, peace, be on thee,\nTake the Spirit's sword in hand;\nBoldly, fearlessly, go forth then,\nIn Jehovah's strength to stand.","And the prince of evil spirits,\nGreat deceiver of the world!\nHe who at the blessed Jesus\nOnce his deadly weapons hurled;\nCometh with unwonted power,\nKnowing that his reign will cease\nWhen the kingdom shall be given\nTo the mighty Prince of Peace.","Christian, rouse! fight in this warfare,\nCease not till the victory's won;\nTill your Captain loud proclaimeth,\n\"Servant of the Lord, well done!\"\nHe, alone, who thus is faithful,\nWho abideth to the end,\nHath the promise, in the kingdom\nAn eternity to spend."],"chorus":""}
