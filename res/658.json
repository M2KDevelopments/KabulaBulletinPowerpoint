Heavenly Father Hear Our Prayer","verses":["Heav'nly Father, hear our prayer\r\nAs we bow before You:\nBless them in the life they share,\r\nHumbly we implore You.\nBe their guide in all endeavors,\r\nBe their hope that nothing severs;\nConstant source of love divine,\r\nLet Your love within them shine!","As they pledge their love this day\nHere before Your altar,\nMay their hearts, upon You stayed,\nNever fail or falter.\nBe their comfort in all sorrow;\nBe their reason for tomorrow.\nGrant them strength to live each hour\nTrusting solely in Your pow'r.","Blest Creator, Lord of life,\nHear our glad thanksgiving.\nHusband you have joined to wife\nFor their earthly living.\nJustified by Jesus' merit.\nLife eternal they inherit.\nWhen their days on earth have passed,\nTake them to Your home at last!"],"chorus":""}
