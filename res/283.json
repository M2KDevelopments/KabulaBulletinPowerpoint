O Jesus, Thou Art Standing","verses":["O Jesus, Thou art standing\nOutside the fast-closed door,\nIn lowly patience waiting\nTo pass the threshold o'er:\nO shame, professing Christian,\nHis name and sign who bear,\nO shame, thrice shame upon us,\nTo keep Him standing there!","O Jesus, Thou art knocking;\nAnd, lo, that hand is scarred,\nAnd thorns Thy brow encircle,\nAnd tears Thy face have marred.\nO love that passeth knowledge,\nSo patiently to wait!\nO sin that hath no equal,\nSo fast to bar the gate!","O Jesus, Thou art pleading\nIn accents meek and low,\n\"I died for you, My children,\nAnd will ye treat Me so?\"\nO Lord, with shame and sorrow\nWe open now the door;\nDear Savior, enter, enter,\nAnd leave us nevermore."],"chorus":""}
