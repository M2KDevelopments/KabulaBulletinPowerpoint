{"number":429,"title":"429. Jerusalem the Golden","verses":["Jerusalem the golden,\nWith milk and honey blest,\nBeneath thy contemplation\nSink heart and voice oppressed.\nI know not, O I know not\nWhat holy joys are there;\nWhat radiancy of glory,\nWhat bliss beyond compare.","They stand, those halls of Zion,\nAll jubilant with song,\nAnd bright with many an angel,\nAnd all the martyr throng.\nThe Prince is ever in them,\nThe daylight is serene;\nThe pastures of the blessed\nAre decked in glorious sheen.","There is the throne of David,\nAnd there, from care released,\nThe shout of them that triumph,\nThe song of them that feast;\nAnd they who, with their Leader,\nHave conquered in the fight,\nForever and forever\nAre clad in robes of white.","O sweet and blessed country,\nThe home of God's elect!\nO sweet and blessed country,\nThat eager hearts expect!\nJesus, in mercy bring us\nTo that dear land of rest;\nWho art, with God the Father,\nAnd Spirit, ever blest."],"chorus":""}
