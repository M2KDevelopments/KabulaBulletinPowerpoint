 

THE HOME WHERE CHANGES NEVER COME

The home where changes ne-ver come, Nor pain nor sor-row, toil nor care
Yes! ‘tis a bright and bless-ed home, Who would not fain be rest-ing there?

CHORUS

O wait meek-ly wait, and mur-mur not, O wait meek—-ly wait and mur-mur not,
O wait ! O wait! O wait and mur-mur not.

Yet when bowed down beneath the load, By Heaven allowed, thine earthly lot;
Thou yearnst to reach that blest a — bode, Wait, meek-ly wait and mur-mur not.

If in thy path some thorns are found, O think who bore them on his brow;
If grief thy sorrowing heart has found, It reached a ho-li-er than thou.

Toil on, nor deem though sore it be, One sigh un-heard, one prayer for-got;
The day of rest will dawn for thee! Wait, meek-ly wait and mur-mur not.
