As We Come to You in Prayer

Now, Dear Lord, as we pray,
take our hearts and minds far away
From the press of the world all
around
To Your throne
where grace does abound.
May our lives be trarsform'd
by Your love,

May our souls be refreshed
from above.

At this moment,
let people everywhere
Join us now
as we come to You in prayer.
