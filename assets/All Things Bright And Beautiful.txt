 

ALL THINGS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL SFJ 51
(cHoRus) All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small; All things
wise and wonderful, The Lord God
made them all.

1) Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings;

He made their glowing colors,

He made their tiny wings. (Horus)
2) The purple headed mountain,
The river running by,

The sunset and the morning

That brightens up the sky. (cHorus)
3) The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,

The ripe fruit in the garden,

He made them every one. (cHorRus)
4) He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell

How great is God Almighty,

Who has made all things well. (cHorus)
