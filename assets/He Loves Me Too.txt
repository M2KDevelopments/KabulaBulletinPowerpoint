 

(SSTT - 74)

HE LOVES ME, TOO

God sees the little sparrow fall,
It meets His tender view;

If God so loves the little birds,
I know He loves me, too.

Chorus: He loves me, too, (2x)
I know He loves me, too;

Because He loves the little things,
I know He loves me, too.

He paints the lily of the field,
Perfumes each lily bell;
If He so loves the little flowers,
I know He loves me, well.

Chorus:

God made the little birds and flowers,
And all things large and small;
He'll not forget His little ones,

I know He loves them all.
Chorus:
