 

(HIOS 85) -

THE BATTLE BELONGS TO THE LORD

In heavenly armor we'll enter the lard,
the battle belongs to the Lord!
No weapon that's fashioned against us
will stand,
the battle belongs to the Lord!

We sing glory, honor, +
power and strength to the Lord.
We sing glory, honor,
power and strength to the Lord!

When the power of darkness comes in
like a flood,
the battle belongs to the Lord!
He's raised up a standard, the power of
His blood,
the battle belongs to the Lord!
