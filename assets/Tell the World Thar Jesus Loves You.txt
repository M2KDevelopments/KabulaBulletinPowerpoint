Tell the World That Jesus Loves You

Tell the world that Jesus loves you.
Tell them you found a forever friend;
You've opened up your heart's door to him,
The love of Jesus has no end!

You can choose what not to believe in,
You can deny there's a heaven above;
But once you take a look at Jesus,
There's no denying that God is love.

Chorus |
If you want to show you really love him,
if you want to prove that your love is true,
Then you'll obey the Word He's spoken,
And do all the things He's commanded you to.

Chorus
