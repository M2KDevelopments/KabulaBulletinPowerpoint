 

The Old Rugged Cross

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,

The emblem of suffering and shame,

And | love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

CHORUS....

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,

Till my trophies at last I lay down;

| will cling to the old rugged cross,

And exchange it some day for a crown.

Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me,

For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,

To bear it to dark Calvary.

Gleams of the Golden Morning

The golden morning is fast approaching;
Jesus soon will come ;

To take His faithful and happy children
To their promised home.

O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
Piercing through this night of gloom!

O, we see the gleams of the golden morning
That will burst the tomb.
