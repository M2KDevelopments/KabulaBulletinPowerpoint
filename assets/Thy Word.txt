(HIOS 88)

THY WORD

Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet
and a light unto my path. (2x)

When I feel afraid,
think I've lost my way
still You're there right beside me.
And nothing will I fear,
as long as you are near.
Please be near me to the end.

Refrain:

I will not forget Your love for me,
and yet my heart forever is wandering.
* Jesus be my guide and hold me to
Your side,
I will love You to the end.

Refrain:
