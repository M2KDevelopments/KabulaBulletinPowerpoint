 

In the Wilderness - Michael Card

In the wilderness In the wilderness

He calls his sons and daughters

To the wilderness. But He gives grace sufficient To
survive any test

And that's the painful purpose

Of the wilderness.

In the wilderness we wander,

In the wilderness we weep.

In the wasteland of our wanting

Where the darkness seems so deep,

We search for the beginning,

For an exodus to home, And find that those who
follow Him Must often walk alone. (Chorus)
In the wilderness we're wondering

For a way to understand.

In the wilderness there's not a way

For the Way's become a man,

And the Man's become the Exodus,

The way to holy ground.

But wandering in the wilderness

Is the best way to be found.

(Chorus) Groaning <nd growing

Amidst the desert days,

The windy winter wilderness

Can blow the self away.

(Chorus) And that's the painful promise Of the
wilderness.
