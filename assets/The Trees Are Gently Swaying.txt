 

THE TREES ARE GENTLY
SWAYING

The trees are gently swaying,
swaying, swaying;

_ The trees are gently swaying,

whispering "God is love."

The birds are swiftly flying,
flying, flying;
The birds are swiftly flying,
singing "God is love."

The flowers are lightly nodding,
nodding, nodding;
The flowers are lightly nodding,
showing God is love.
