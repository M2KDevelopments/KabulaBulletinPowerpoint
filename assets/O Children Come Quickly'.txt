 

O Children, Come Quickly

O Children, come quickly, O come, one and all!
O come to the cfadle in Bethlehem’s stall,

And gaze on tHe wonder, the gift from above
Our Father in heaven ~hath sent us with love.

How datk is the stable, How dark is the night;
Yet see how the manger is beaming with light.
QO gaze on the Babe in the crib where he lies,
More fait than the angels that dwell in the —
skies. cuacacien uae

He lies in the-manger, He dies in the hay,

With Jeseph and Mary beside him to stay.
The shepherds. are kneeling m rev’rence and
prayer,

- While songs of the angels are fillimg -the air.

Ihr Kinderlein, -kommet, O kommet- doch all,
-Zur -Krippe -her- kommet -in Bethleheni’s Stall
Und seht, was in dieser hochheiligefl Nacht
Der Vater im Himmel ftir Freude unsiMacht.
