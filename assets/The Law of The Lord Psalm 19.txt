 

HIOS 97

THE LAW OF THE LORD (Psalm 19)

The law of the Lord is perfect,
refreshing my soul. The word of the

Lord is sure, revealing His wisdom.
(CHORUS)

More to be desired are they than
gold, Yea, than much fine gold:
Sweeter also than honey, and the
honeycomb.

2) The standards of the Lord are
right, bestowing great joy.

The command of the Lord is pure,

directing my way.
(CHORUS)

3) May the words that | speak
aloud, And my mind's secret
whisperings,Be according to your
will, O Lord,My Rock and my
Redeemer. (uorus)
