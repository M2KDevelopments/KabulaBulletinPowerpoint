THIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE

 

 

This little light of mine, I'm going
to let it shine.

This little light of mine, I'm going
to let it shine,

Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

Everywhere | go, I'm going to let it
shine (x3)
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

All through the night, I'm aang to
let it shine (x3)

Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
