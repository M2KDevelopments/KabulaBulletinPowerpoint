“TIS THE BLESSED HOUR OF PRAYER

’Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our
hearts lowly bend,

And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and
Friend;

If we come to Him in faith, His protection to
share,

What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be
there!

Refrain

Blessed hour of prayer, Blessed hour of
prayer, —

What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be
there!

°Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the
Savior draws near,

With a tender compassion His children to ©
hear;

| When He tells us we may cast at His feet every
care,

What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be
there!
