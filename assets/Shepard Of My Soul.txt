 

HIOS 99

SHEPHERD OF MY SOUL

Shepherd of my soul, | give you
full control; Wherever You may
lead | will follow. | have made
the choice to listen for Your
voice; Wherever you may lead |
will go.

Be it in a quiet pasture or by a
gentle stream, the Shepherd of
my soul is by my side.

Should | face a mighty
mountain

Or a valley dark and deep,

The Shepherd of my soul will
be my guide. D.C.
