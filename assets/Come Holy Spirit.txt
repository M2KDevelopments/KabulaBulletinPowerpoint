 

COME, HOLY SPIRIT

Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly
Dove,

With all Thy quickening
powers;

Kindle a flame of sacred love
In these coll hearts of ours.

VERSE 2

O raise our thoughts from
things below,

From vanities and toys!
Then shall we with fresh
courage go

To reach eternal joys.

VERSE 3

Awake our souls to joyful songs;
Let pure devotions rise;

Till praise employs our thankful
tongues,

And doubt forever dies. â€”
