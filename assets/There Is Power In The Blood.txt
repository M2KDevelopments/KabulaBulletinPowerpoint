 

THERE IS POWER IN THE BLOOD

Would you be free from the burden of sin?
There’s power in the blood, power in the
blood; Would you o’er evil a victory win?
There's wonderful power in the blood.

CHORUS:

There is power, power, wonder working
power In the blood of the lamb;

There is power, power, wonder working
power In the precious blood of the lamb.

Would you be free from your passion and
pride? There's power in the blood, power in
the blood; Come for a cleansing to Calvary's
tide; There’s wonderful power in the Llood.
(CHORUS)

Would you be whiter, much whiter than
snow? There's power in the blood, power in
the blood. Sin stains are lost in its lifegiving
flow; There's wonde: ‘ul power it. the blood.
(CHORUS)
