 

HIOS 53

THE SWEETEST NAME OF ALL

Jesus, you're the sweetest name of
all. Jesus, you always hear me when
| call. Oh, Jesus, you pick me up
each time | fall, You're the sweetest,
the sweetest name of all.

Jesus, how | love to praise your
name. Jesus, you're still the first, the
last, the same. Oh, Jesus, you died
and took away my shame, You're the
sweetest, the sweetest name of all.

Jesus, you're the soon and coming
King. Jesus, we need the love that
you can bring. Oh, Jesus, we lift our
voices up and sing, You're the
sweetest, the sweetest name of all.
