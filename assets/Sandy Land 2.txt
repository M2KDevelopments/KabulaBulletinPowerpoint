 

Sandy Land
Don't build your house on the
sandy land,
Don't build it too near the shore. â€”
Well, it might look kind of nice, -
~ but you'll have to build it twice;
Oh, you'll have to build your
house once more.
You better build your house upon
a rock,
_ Make a good foundation on a
solid spot.
Oh, the storms may come and |
go, ,
But the peace of God you will
know.
