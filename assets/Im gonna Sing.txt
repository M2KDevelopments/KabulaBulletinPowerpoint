 

HIOS 10
I'M GONNA SING

I'm gonna sing, sing, sing

I'm gonna shout, shout, shout

. I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna shout
Praise the Lord. When those gates
are open wide I'm gonna sit by
Jesusâ€™ side. I'm gonna sing, I'm
gonna shout, Praise the Lord.

2) Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home (x2)
3) Oh, when the saints go
marching in, When the saints go
marching in, Oh Lord | want to be
in that number When the saints go
marching in. ,

4) This al is bound for glory,
This train. This train is bound for
glory, This train. This train is bound
for glory, If you want to go to
heaven, You've got to be holy; This
train is bound for glory, This train.
