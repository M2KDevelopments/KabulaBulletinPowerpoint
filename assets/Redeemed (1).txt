Redeemed!

Redeemed, how | love to proclaim it!

Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed throâ€™ His infinite mercy,
His child, and forever | am.

Chorus:

Redeemed, Redeemed,

Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, how I love to prociaim itt"
His child and forever | am.

 

_ | think of my blessed Redeemer,
| think of Him all the day long;
i.sing, for | cannot be silent;

His love is the theme of my song.

| know | shall see in His beauty

The king in whose law I delight,
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night.
