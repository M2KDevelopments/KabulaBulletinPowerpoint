Year of Precious Blessings

year of precious blessings, And glorious
victories won,

Of earnest work progressing, Its onward course |
has run;

To Thee, O God, our Refuge, Whose pe ignenaess
crowns our days,

Within Thy earthly temple We lift our souls in
praise;

_ Within Thy earthly temple We lift our souls in
praise

Thou Master of assemblies, In mighty power
descend,

Behold our glad reunion, Conduct it to the end;
Inspire our hearts with courage, And deeper love
for Thee,

That all Thy name may honer, Where’re our. field
may be;

That all Thy name may honor, Where’er our field
may- be.

O church of God’s Anointed, March on the lost to
win,

Lead forth thy ranks victorious Against. the

hosts of sin; ‘

Till at-His throne in glory, Where angels

prostrate fall,

One hallelujah chorus Shall crown Him Lord of all;
One hallelujah chorus Shall crown Him Lord of all.’
