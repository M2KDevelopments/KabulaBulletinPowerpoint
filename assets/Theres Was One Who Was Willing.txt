 

THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS WILLING

1. There was one who was will-ing to die in my stead, That a
a soul so un-woth-y might live, And the path to the cross
He was will-ing to tread, All the sins of my life to for-give.

CHORUS
They are nailed to the cross, They are nailed to the cross,
O how much He was will-ing to bear ! With what an-guish
And loss, Je-sus went to the cross ! But He car-ried my
Sins with Him there.

2. He ic ten-der and lov-ing and pa-tient with me, While He
Cleane-es my heart of its dross, But “there’s no
Con-dem-na-tion;” I know I am free, for my sins are
nailed to the cross..

3. I will cling to my Sav-iour and nev-er de-part-I will
Joy-ful-ly jour-ney each day, With a song on my lips and
a Song in my heart, That my sins have been tak-en a-way
