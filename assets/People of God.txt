 

PEOPLE. OF GoD

Come let us sing our confession

Let. us hold to one eked alone

For He has erased our trans gression

Washed us and made. us : His own, His very own.
We’ re. the people of God, called by His name
Out of the dark, delivered emus shame -
One holy race, > gaints every one
Because of the blood of Christ, sess the Son

Hear all ye susisdte of darkness a - D

So you may know where ‘we stand”

We are His people, the purchase of scars

Bought by‘the blood of the Lamb, ine blood of the Lamb ?
