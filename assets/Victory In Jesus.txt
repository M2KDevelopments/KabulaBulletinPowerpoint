 

VICTORY IN JESUS

| heard an old, old story, how a Savior came from glory,
How He gave His life on Calvary, to save a wretch like
me;

| heard about His groaning, of His precious bloodâ€™s
atoning,

Then | repented of my sins anc won the victory.

Chorus

O victory in Jesus, my Savior, forever! He sought me and
bought me with His redeeming blood; He loved me ere |
knew Him, and all m. love is due Him-- He plunged me to
victory, beneath the cleansing flood.
