 

SEEK YE FIRST
(Matthew 6:33)

Seek ye first the kingdom of God,

And His righteousness;

And all these things shall be added unto you.
Allelu, alletuia.

Man does not live by bread alone,

But by every word

That proceeds from the mouth of the Lord.
Allelu, alleluia.

Ask, and it shall be given unto you,

Seek, and ye shall find,

Knock, and the door shall be opened unto you.

Allelu, alleluia.
